To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the\ntask and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of\ntask-relevant information.

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately\nclustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the\naccuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively. This gap\neven increases with the reduction of clustering centers.

To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector\nQuantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two\nkey modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors\ninto their polar coordinate representations and perform independent\nquantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned\nCodebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude\ncodebooks in accordance with the source distribution.

In theory, one would\ngreatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal\ntransport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a\nhighly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In\npractice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and\n$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.\nThese works have advocated using batches of size $n\\approx 256$, and considered\nOT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the\nHungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.\nSinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits\nof increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully\non the effect of the entropic regularization $\\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to\nreport the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across\nmultiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$.

Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by\ntransferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,\nreducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.\nHowever, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts\nin the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as\ncatastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning\nframework inspired by the strength training principle of \"progressive overload\"\n(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD\napproaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two\ncore components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training\nsamples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally\nintroduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while\napplying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting\nwith the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the\napproach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive\nexperiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL\nconsistently improves the performance of distilled student models across\nvarious white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the\neffectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our\nwork demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to\nenhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs."}

Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also\nextends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on\nMTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference\ntime without retraining."}

Many focus on peripheral,\n``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval\nover deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack."}
