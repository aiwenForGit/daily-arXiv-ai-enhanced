This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift.

Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of\nour method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)"}

However,\nexisting methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which\nrepresents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the\nFederated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the\nknowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared\ninformation across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client\nas the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL\nframework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each\nclient, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert\ndistillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of\nfine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared\nknowledge across clusters.

DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a\nnovel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate\natomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling\nefficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.\nDualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing\nbenchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms\nprior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating\nits broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks."}

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance.

Unlike metric learning or encoding\nnetworks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property\nvalue and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between\ndata samples and the query example provided by the user.

These\nlimitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision\nscenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that\nintegrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the\nanalytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and\nexecution.
