However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum.

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is\ncentralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased\ncommunication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective\nalternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the\nneed to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental\nresults show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when\ndealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate\ndetrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different\ndata distributions."}

However, the sheer volume and nuanced nature of\nreviews make manual identification and prioritization of privacy-related\nconcerns challenging for developers. Previous studies have developed software\nutilities to automatically classify user reviews as privacy-relevant,\nprivacy-irrelevant, bug reports, feature requests, etc., using machine\nlearning. Notably, there is a lack of focus on classifying reviews specifically\nas privacy-related feature requests, privacy-related bug reports, or\nprivacy-irrelevant. This paper introduces SENtinel SORt (SENSOR), an automated\nonline annotation tool designed to help developers annotate and classify user\nreviews into these categories. For automating the annotation of such reviews,\nthis paper introduces the annotation model, GRACE (GRU-based Attention with\nCBOW Embedding), using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) with Continuous Bag of Words\n(CBOW) and Attention mechanism. Approximately 16000 user reviews from seven\npopular social media apps on Google Play Store, including Instagram, Facebook,\nWhatsApp, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook Lite, and Line were\nanalyzed. Two annotators manually labelled the reviews, achieving a Cohen's\nKappa value of 0.87, ensuring a labeled dataset with high inter-rater agreement\nfor training machine learning models. Among the models tested, GRACE\ndemonstrated the best performance (macro F1-score: 0.9434, macro ROC-AUC:\n0.9934, and accuracy: 95.10%) despite class imbalance. SENSOR demonstrates\nsignificant potential to assist developers with extracting and addressing\nprivacy-related feature requests or bug reports from user reviews, enhancing\nuser privacy and trust."}

Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph.

However, most\ncurrent approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to\ntask requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce\na novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically\ngenerates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of\nconstructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies\nthat boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond\nclassical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,\nnearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the\nclassical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered\nup to ~20% higher accuracy.
