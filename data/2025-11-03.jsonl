While prior work has explored data poisoning during\nstatic pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual\npre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory\ntruth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods\nincreases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar\nvulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but\nconfidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from\nthe truth.\n  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief\ndynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of\npoisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,\nmodel scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs\nshift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent\nrepresentational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying\nacross layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked\nvulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize\nmisinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust\nmonitoring of factual integrity during model updates."}

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better\nviewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues."}

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream.

Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling.

This study presents a graph-based computational approach that\noperationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and\nannotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic\nTime Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and\ninter-segment relationships.\n  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further\nlabeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor\nI-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level.\nThis labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive\ninformation, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and\nresolution.\n  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within\ncompositions.

This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.
