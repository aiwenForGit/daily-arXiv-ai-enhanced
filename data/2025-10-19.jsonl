We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return.

To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on\nHierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC\nachieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design.\nIn the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing\nmutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive\nview weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity\nbetween individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by\nweighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally,\nHSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent\nrepresentations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes\nreconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of\ncompletion and clustering.

Theoretically, we establish an oracle property for\nSROF-achieving correct variable-level group recovery with asymptotic\nnormality-and prove convergence of RowFed to a stationary solution. Under\nrandom client participation, the iterate gap contracts at a rate that improves\nwith participation probability. Empirically, simulations in heterogeneous\nregimes show that RowFed consistently lowers estimation and prediction error\nand strengthens variable-level cluster recovery over NonFed, FedAvg, and a\npersonalized matrix-fusion baseline. A real-data study further corroborates\nthese gains while preserving interpretability.

While this\npattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with\nthe prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization.

However, previous practice requires the LLM\nto sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate\nprompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we\ntheoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of\nself-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true\nreasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,\nwhich is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token\nlog-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last\ntoken and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient.

Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all\ntokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little\nacross most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial\nredundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\\bf MASK}$ tokens\nprimarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active\nprediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that\nselective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the\nmost-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative\nlower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose\n${\\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that\njointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the\nmost-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that\nrecomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and\noff-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs\nadaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant\ncomputation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation\nquality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across\nmathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent\nspeedups: $8.7\\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\\times$ on longer sequences,\nand $4.8\\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy\nthan the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput\n($6.8\\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while\npreserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs."}

However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned\nrepresentations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D\nnature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and\ndiminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction\nand generation with high 3D consistency."}

This is a critical bottleneck, as\nsuch naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds\nuse synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of\nexisting models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the\npretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new\ntraining paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our\napproach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during\ntraining and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each\ninput and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the\ninstruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for\nend-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution\nmatching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the\nimage manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard\nbenchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,\nour method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained\non extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same\nVLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO."}

Given recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We\napproach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task\nin which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional\ndemands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To\nsupport this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the\nmachine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical\nsimulation and reward-driven evaluation.
