The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and\nPDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics.\nFor two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of\nparameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique,\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from\nknown target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the\ntarget parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on\na compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in\ncomputational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN\nfor the models considered.

Meanwhile,\nsimilarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific,\nlimiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors\nin Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves\nricher information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on\ntheoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the\naggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the\npredictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts.

To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization.
