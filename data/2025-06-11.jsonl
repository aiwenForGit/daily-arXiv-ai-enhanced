In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method\nfor KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to\nevaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model\nloss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision\nquantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers\nwhile aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable\nbalance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic\nlong-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV\npairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving\nhigh-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix\nprovides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize\ncomputational overhead.

In this work, we argue that it is important to model the\nhierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem\n(which \\textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority\nover the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical\nstructure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the\nlower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the\nupper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new\nformulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning\n(\\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but\nmore importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that \\texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and\nmetrics.

Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset.

In\nthis work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model\n(MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission\nsystems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial\ncontingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative\ndecision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy\ngradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the\nunmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning\nmethod converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward\ndesign, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating\nsystem conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus\nsystems.

In\nthis work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational\ncomplexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for\nvarious ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity\npatterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under\nstandard complexity assumptions like P$\\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains\nintractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the\ncomplexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles\nof decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles\nwith even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe\nthat our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the\ninterpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through\na computational complexity lens."}

Unlike existing model-based methods that learn\ndynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched\ndynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these\ndatasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY\nlearns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states\nand transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize\ntraining, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the\npolicy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that\nregularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather\nthan uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned\nfrom an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented\nsource data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate\nMOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in\nchallenging scenarios."}

Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token\nprobabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses\noptimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves\nalignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by\nusing the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent\ntoken-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,\nraising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,\nlightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment\nbenchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO\nconsistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better\nalignment with zero additional computational overhead."}

These strategies aim to produce\ninformative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select\nthe most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring\nrobust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic\nsimilarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups\nfeatures at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering\nsimilar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating\nmore complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing\nthe performance of existing models."}

Traffic intersections are critical\ncomponents of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%\nof fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well\nas the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important\nquestion: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and\nmicro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep\nGenerative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting\npoint to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they\nare not tested in a \"live\" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on\ntraffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic\nengineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models\nand provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so.

However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate\nfor the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal\npatterns.\n  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values\nfrom input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source\nLMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with\nremarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged\nby our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary\narithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered\nby our probe can mitigate these errors."}

However, conventional cross-modal contrastive\nlearning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation\ncapabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language\nalignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked\nmodeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual\nrepresentation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through\nAdapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes\nonly about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the\ncomputational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves\nsuperior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and\nzero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked\nrecord modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph\ninputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their\ncorresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language\nalignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the\nbest-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image\naccuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval\naccuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment\nalso promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA."}

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This\nis because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible\ndue to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy\nconstraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework\nthat quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the\ntraining data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose\nDecentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of\ntraining and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only\nmodel parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and\ndeployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target\nsample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on\nfour medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,\nhistopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against\nexisting methods while respecting data-privacy.
