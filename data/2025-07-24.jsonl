This study\ninvestigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help\nstandardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were\ncollected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data\nconsists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a\ncorresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data\npre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and\noptionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.\nAfterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural\nnetwork, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final\nsocket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the\nsocket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's\nperformance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the\nAI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.\nFirst, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface\nerror between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.\nSecond, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are\nutilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the\nrequired adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.\nThe random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest\nerror with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first\nquartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters."}

MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle.

We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs).

To mitigate these limitations, existing\napproaches typically employ gradient compression and delayed aggregation to\nalleviate low bandwidth and high latency, respectively. To address both\nchallenges simultaneously, these strategies are often combined, introducing a\ncomplex three-way trade-off among compression ratio, staleness (delayed\nsynchronization steps), and model convergence rate. To achieve the balance\nunder varying bandwidth conditions, an adaptive policy is required to\ndynamically adjust these parameters.

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes\nthe optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional\nmetric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies\nbetween probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation,\nwe leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional\nGAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a\nlow-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for\npolicy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy\nupdates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods.\nAlgorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared\nwith the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance."}

In this paper, we explore a\nmore challenging open-set graph class-incremental learning scenario with two\nintertwined challenges: catastrophic forgetting of old classes, which impairs\nthe detection of unknown classes, and inadequate open-set recognition, which\ndestabilizes the retention of learned knowledge. To address the above problems,\na novel OGCIL framework is proposed, which utilizes pseudo-sample embedding\ngeneration to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enable robust\ndetection of unknown classes. To be specific, a prototypical conditional\nvariational autoencoder is designed to synthesize node embeddings for old\nclasses, enabling knowledge replay without storing raw graph data.

One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation?

Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we\npresent a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate\nclass-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods."}
