This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling\ndatasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how\nthese technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to\nsociety in broader areas.

While elegant\ntheories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world\napplications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for\ninferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under\nfinite data and time constraints, where \"performing well\" implies achieving\nhigh, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the\nLearnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in\nsupervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately\nCorrect (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by\nValiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)\nDiscovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.\nThis framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for\nestablished causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental\nvariable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical\nguarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case\nSeries (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees."}
