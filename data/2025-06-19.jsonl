We introduce\nRetrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects\nsuch behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization.

However, conventional annotation methods heavily\nrely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing\nnon-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these\nchallenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that\nautomates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic\nannotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural\nnetworks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and\nincorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail\nenvironments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach\nover traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator\nlabeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.\nRemarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video\nannotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of\ndetected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process\nfor the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can\nsignificantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection\nenables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,\nproving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey\nanalysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring."}

Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase\nthe utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling\ngoal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps."}
