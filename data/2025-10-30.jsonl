We present Fortytwo, a\nnovel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed\npairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our\napproach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a\npeer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that\nsurfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom\nBradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference\nsubstantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond\nversus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of\n+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol\nincorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated\naccuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality\nor malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs\nproof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete\ncalibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making\nmulti-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.\nAcross six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and\nAIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to\nadversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation\nof only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while\nretaining practical deployability.

Across tuned hyperparameters across the\nboard, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise\ncounterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral\ndescent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not\nexplained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP\ndisplays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends\nalong the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that\nmatrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of\nmatrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.\nExperiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently\noutperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of\nMuon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while\nlookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance\nestimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss."}

While\nprior research has focused on protecting privacy in a single data release, many\nreal-world systems operate under sequential or continuous data publishing,\nwhere the same or related data are released over time. Such sequential\ndisclosures introduce new vulnerabilities, as temporal correlations across\nreleases may enable adversaries to infer sensitive information that remains\nhidden in any individual release. In this paper, we investigate whether an\nattacker can compromise privacy in sequential data releases by exploiting\ndependencies between consecutive publications, even when each individual\nrelease satisfies standard privacy guarantees. To this end, we propose a novel\nattack model that captures these sequential dependencies by integrating a\nHidden Markov Model with a reinforcement learning-based bi-directional\ninference mechanism. This enables the attacker to leverage both earlier and\nlater observations in the sequence to infer private information. We instantiate\nour framework in the context of trajectory data, demonstrating how an adversary\ncan recover sensitive locations from sequential mobility datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on Geolife, Porto Taxi, and SynMob datasets show that our model\nconsistently outperforms baseline approaches that treat each release\nindependently. The results reveal a fundamental privacy risk inherent to\nsequential data publishing, where individually protected releases can\ncollectively leak sensitive information when analyzed temporally.

Early detection through mammography screening plays a\npivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)\nsystems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face\ncritical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the\nnuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the\nrequirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework\nthat synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with\nstructured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata\nand synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.\nOur proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of\nconvolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves\nsuperior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling\nhigh-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse\npopulations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,\nour multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and\ncalcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular\nimprovements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing\nclinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data\nand contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms."}

In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges.
