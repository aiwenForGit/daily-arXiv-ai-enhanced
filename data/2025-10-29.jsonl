This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal\ninteractions and more effective joint representation learning. To further\nenhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual\nTransformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN\nincorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine\ntextual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text\nand image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.\nEmpirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy\n(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on\nMVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score.

A general assumption of\ntraining the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that\nthe errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error\ncorrelations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly\nformulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is\nintroduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned\ncoefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an\ninference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically\nrefine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time\nforecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on\ndifferent traffic datasets.

Its energy function couples\nAlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,\nbalancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder\ndesign task, RSS produces 5$\\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\\times$\ngreater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.\nThese results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring\nthe protein design landscape."}

Through application\nof augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question\nAnswering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including\nstate-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to\nperturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave\nstereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have\nbiased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community\nless studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and\nsafety research to include more diverse communities."}

Despite\nadvances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer\nknowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).\nA key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across\nLLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility\nand broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural\nincompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences\nbetween LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer\nparameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic\nalignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale\nknowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our\napproach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.\nLeveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and\noutperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.\nEvaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further\nanalysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and\nprovides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment."}

To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a\nnovel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the\ndata generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data\nvia downstream task feedback.

This paper\nanalyses how these two model classes have performed on real-world tabular data.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of papers that\nperformed empirical comparisons of GAMs and neural networks. Eligible papers\nwere identified, yielding 143 papers, with 430 datasets. Key attributes at both\npaper and dataset levels were extracted and reported. Beyond summarising\ncomparisons, we analyse reported performance metrics using mixed-effects\nmodelling to investigate potential characteristics that can explain and\nquantify observed differences, including application area, study year, sample\nsize, number of predictors, and neural network complexity. Across datasets, no\nconsistent evidence of superiority was found for either GAMs or neural networks\nwhen considering the most frequently reported metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, and AUC).\nNeural networks tended to outperform in larger datasets and in those with more\npredictors, but this advantage narrowed over time. Conversely, GAMs remained\ncompetitive, particularly in smaller data settings, while retaining\ninterpretability. Reporting of dataset characteristics and neural network\ncomplexity was incomplete in much of the literature, limiting transparency and\nreproducibility. This review highlights that GAMs and neural networks should be\nviewed as complementary approaches rather than competitors. For many tabular\napplications, the performance trade-off is modest, and interpretability may\nfavour GAMs."}

A long-standing question remained on its capacity to\ntackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going\nbeyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively\nanswer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer\nperceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it\nmore prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive\nthan narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the\nchallenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and\ndata are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider\nthe matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of\nlearning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the\nsufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network\nas the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various\nlearning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through\nmodel's \"specialisation\" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for\ntraining algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by\nthe theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating\nfrom shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer.\nFurthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the\nBayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and\nfinite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning\nregime that are potentially relevant way beyond it."}

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as\nsoft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,\nespecially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a\ncomprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual\ntransfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis\nfurther explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as\nthe impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix\nmethods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.\nSimilar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well.

Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context\nsaturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly\nsummarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical\ndetails. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm\ncentered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive\nprocess of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a\ndynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log\nto be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which\nmanages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular\ncondensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations\nto abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent\nbenchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual\npre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp\nand 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH.

Kording"], "title": "Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "q-bio.NC"], "comment": "Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that\ncollectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human\ncognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a\nlow-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal\nactively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations\ndegrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,\nimplying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining\nobjective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and\nhighlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges\nnaturally in a connectionist system."}
