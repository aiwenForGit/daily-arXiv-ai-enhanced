In this paper we show that it is possible to use an\nimage-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of\nprime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted\nfrom regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on\nblocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This\nimplies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in\nthe latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem\nto imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in\ndifferent regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at\nlower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns\nwith number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we\nshould see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages\n(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness\nregularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward\nan interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new\nexperimental instrument for number theory.

A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for\ndementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models\nin clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited\ngeneralizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for early detection. By outlining both progress and open\nproblems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically\nmeaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research."}

However, predictive\nmodeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property\nrelationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical\nenvironments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined\nwith sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across\nmaterial families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a\nunified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to\ncapture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels,\nincluding structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization.\nITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and\nrelational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them\nthrough a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning\nacross scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised\npretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised\nfine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable\npredictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties.

However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require\nretraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.\nThere also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated\ndata and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream\ntasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces\nleads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we\npropose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the\nDS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed\nto avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based\nhierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,\nthe generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they\noriginate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets\nto validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the\ndiscriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The\ndistributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further\nreduced, the inference process is also more interpretable.

Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,\nand effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic\ngraphical models."}

By generating pseudo-samples from\nbiased, low-quality RCT data and matching them with the most similar samples\nfrom large-scale observational data, the method expands the RCT dataset while\nmitigating its heterogeneity. We validated the method through simulation\nexperiments, conducted offline and online tests using real-world data. In a\nweek-long online experiment, we achieved a 0.41\\% improvement in profit, which\nis a considerable gain when scaled to industrial scenarios with hundreds of\nmillions in revenue. In addition, we discuss the harm to model training,\noffline evaluation, and online economic benefits when the RCT data quality is\nnot high, and emphasize the importance of improving RCT data quality in\nindustrial scenarios.

While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context.

The development of\npredictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm\nimpacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this\nstudy, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing\nintervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine\nthree different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types,\nsites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in\na given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions.\nOur approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate\nmodeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit\nproblem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and\noyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area\nthat was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael. Our analysis predicts\nthat intervention optimization could be used to potentially save billions of\ndollars in storm damage, far outpacing greedy or non-optimal solutions."}

Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and\nlongitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation\nmethods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds\nof lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored\nto this challenge.\n  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation\nmodel that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment\nAnything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was\ntrained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using\nT2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient\nlevel into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three\nreflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength\nvariation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).\n  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of\n0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:\n0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained\nunder MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:\n0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1\nscores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader\nvariability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68),\ncomparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).\n  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable\ninteractive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong\ngeneralization, supporting integration into clinical workflows."}

Yet robot policies often lack\nsufficient exploration capability due to action mode collapse. Existing methods\nthat encourage exploration typically rely on random perturbations, which are\nunsafe and induce unstable, erratic behaviors, thereby limiting their\neffectiveness. We propose Self-Improvement via On-Manifold Exploration (SOE), a\nframework that enhances policy exploration and improvement in robotic\nmanipulation. SOE learns a compact latent representation of task-relevant\nfactors and constrains exploration to the manifold of valid actions, ensuring\nsafety, diversity, and effectiveness. It can be seamlessly integrated with\narbitrary policy models as a plug-in module, augmenting exploration without\ndegrading the base policy performance. Moreover, the structured latent space\nenables human-guided exploration, further improving efficiency and\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SOE consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving higher\ntask success rates, smoother and safer exploration, and superior sample\nefficiency. These results establish on-manifold exploration as a principled\napproach to sample-efficient policy self-improvement. Project website:\nhttps://ericjin2002.github.io/SOE"}

However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human\ndemonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the\ndiminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the\nenvironment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still,\ntraining RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to\nsample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from\nsparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom\n(DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL\nthrough a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as\nblack-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via\nsample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only\nsparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies\non high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world.\nIn particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nsuccessful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands.
