However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering\ntransaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging\nsystems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal\nentity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the\nvariations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an\ninvestigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment\ntheir knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace\nfunds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy\nmatching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid\nstring similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based\npipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering\nfor unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to\nsupplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of\nprecision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates\nsignificantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')\napproach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based\nsystems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the\nlatter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a\nsubset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions\ninvestigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing\nentity variations."}

This paper introduces CALM\n(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for\nreal-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built\non the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm\nfoundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's\nnovelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,\ncontinuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to\nadapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an\nLLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,\ncontext-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training\ndataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful\npattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our\nresults demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC\nscore in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,\nvalidating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining\nhigh-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments."}

Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD).

Nevertheless,\nthis assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view\nand limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the\nfirst comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific\nfragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion\nprobability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair\nof peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million\nhigh-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide\nassignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance\nusing simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models\nleveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous\nmethods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance\nacross benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the\npeptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring\nsophisticated machine learning approaches."}

Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable\nperformance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment\nrecommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.\nWhile hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert\noversight before clinical implementation."}

Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes\nassume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making\nthem vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We\nclose this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models\ndynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive\npolicy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian\nwatermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing\nsystem knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control\nperformance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We\ndevelop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence\nin linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,\nunderpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D\ncontroller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by\n70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance\nbaselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one\nsampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,\nrapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding\nexisting benchmarks."}

In many settings,\ntreatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.\nRather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of\nsubsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue\nand its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this\nwork. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated\nwith ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential\ntreatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the\nwaiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as\na time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how\ng-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how\nadjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in\nbetween treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification\nwith discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide\nimplementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our\nconcluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid\ninference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods\nthat adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders."}
