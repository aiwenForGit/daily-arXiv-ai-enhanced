This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone.

In\nthis position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the\ncompositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.\nAs such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant\nfunctions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of\nwhich relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this\nproperty is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is\ntherefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some\npromising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and\ngeneralization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,\nseveral important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs\nremain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep\nlearning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even\ngeneral, intelligence."}

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN\nremoval grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger\nmodels is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.\nFurthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models.

Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions.

In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a\nvector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the\norigin and a positive vector in ${\\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the\nminimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown\nvariables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation\nof data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust\nalternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as\nsupport vector machines and gradient descent.

Building on this, we extend the methodology using\nVariational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the\nlatent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for\nmore nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The\nproposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk\nestimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall.

Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

The continuous advancement of\nattack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms\nthat can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of\nML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on\nimplementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and\nethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack\nscenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective\nmethods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper\npresents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and\ncorresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,\nrepresenting various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,\nspoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack\nmodels augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to\nconfigure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and\npromote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated\nattack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,\nin which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural\nnetwork IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and\nscalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high\ndetection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and\neffectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also\nelaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world\nscenarios and provide insights into its application."}

To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching."}

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or\nstate-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R."}
