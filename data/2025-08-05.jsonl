While data-driven findings in AI\noffer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many\nare difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is\nthe uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science\nlife cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC.

As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness.

This allows users to express a wider range of\nedits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first\ninstruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and\ninstructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then\ndecodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a\nstructured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between\nembeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits\ntogether, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use\nsynthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art\ntime series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable\nstrength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to\nunseen conditions through few-shot learning."}

Recent advances move beyond\ndiscrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward\ncontinuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential\nEquations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the\nunderlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,\nextrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the\ndynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably\nunder distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as\nthe continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics\nsolely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories\ntoward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To\nachieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and\n(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain\nrich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to\nprocess past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to\nextract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.\nDuring training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future\ntrajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal\ncurrent action.

During testing phase, the test data\nare thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic\nstatistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The\npredicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed\nrepresentation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its\nrespective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,\nsymbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the\nproposed method: \\emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,\ndemonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning\nalgorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer\nWisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for\nstate-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the\nclassification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,\nwhich are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information\nprocessing."}

In this\nwork, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the\nLSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom\nfilter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query\nlatency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned\nmodels and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without\ncompromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style\nLSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic\nworkloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up\nto 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,\nthough it incurs a modest false-negative rate.

However, for modern applications, e.g.,\nthe optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require\nhundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over\na high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs\n$\\mathbf{x}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated\ninputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.\nExisting black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''\n(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address\nthis, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)\napproach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\\mathbf{x}^*$\nthat leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently\ninferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can\nselect solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.\nAssuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with\nunknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM\nestimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization\nrate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,\nthus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a\npractical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive\nGaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nBOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector\noptimization in nuclear physics."}

Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the\nmodel is prone to \"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of\npreviously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior\nupdate principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is\ninsensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the\nforgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We\nconduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results\nshow that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models."}
