This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables.

Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local\nlow-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated\nsetting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn\nthe shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike\n[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold\nfor the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model\npersonalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of\nusers' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).\nAdditionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term\nin [JRS+21] by a factor of $\\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary\nclassification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to\nprivately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy\nguarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the\nshared embedding and the users' data.

This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon\naverage-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and\nreward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller\ndetermines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a\nprivate reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which\nrepresents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition\nkernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate\nthe problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the\nenvironment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper\nconsiders a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market\ncontinues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,\ntruthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential\nauctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves\nthese desired properties.

In this paper, we propose a\nphysics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network\n(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc\nboost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A\nphysics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also\ntrained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using\nstep-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of\naccuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform\nthe FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median\nRMSE.

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to\nefficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model\ninference phase.

A standard transformer model incorporating\nrelative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million\nparameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model\nwith 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative\npositional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with\nthe shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different\nattention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional\nencoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to\nserve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular\nconformations."}

Using naive variants of differential privacy in\nsuch use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,\nwe refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework\nthat we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is\nsimulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants\nof privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and\nnon-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive\ncomposition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference\nattacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that\nsatisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via\nsub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show\nthat it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public\nfeatures are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ\ndataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to\nDP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a\ntraining image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a\nnew approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of\nDP while still providing strong privacy guarantees."}

A rigorous proof\nfor its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps\nin this direction were taken in the paper \\cite{Gh1}, which proved that for\n\\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian\nkernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in\n\\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with\ndifferentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper\n\\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\\textit{ without\nany restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a\ncontinuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the\ntrajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies\nthe {\\L}ojasiewicz property there.\n  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of\n\\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}\nconvergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \\textit{any radially symmetric\nand strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate\ncharacterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by\nSchoenberg and Bernstein \\cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in\n\\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is\nmore restrictive than that of \\cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it\nuses a different set of assumptions than \\cite{YT}, and the proof technique is\ndifferent."}

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal\nEnergy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish\nas spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical\ndecay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we\npropose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log\nn)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute\ndensity, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense\nattention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial\nAttention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to\nspatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal\ndistance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend\ntheir generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across\nWan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup\nover the original dense attention.
