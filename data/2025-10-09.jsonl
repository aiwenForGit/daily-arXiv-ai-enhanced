Meta-path scores extracted from this\n8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward\nstochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically\nplausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining\nscore-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces\ntimestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag\ntriples that contain no protected health information. On simulated\nultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by\ngreater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream\npredictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the\nDOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55\nsafe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61\nplus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong\nresistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating\nbiomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can\nsimultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for\nrare-disease research."}

In this work, we evaluate whether\nthis architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot\nsuper-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on\nhigher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing.

This paper proposes a hybrid architecture\nintegrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer\n(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module\nfirst applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill\nsalient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and\ndimensionality.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

Final version may vary from this preprint", "summary": "The 2024 July Revolution in Bangladesh represents a landmark event in the\nstudy of civil resistance. This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases\nsolvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like\nunder complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over\nsolution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with\nrecommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:\nincorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,\nrethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing\ninductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to\nreason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic\nforgetting, and step wise calibration.

This paradigm introduces\nunique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting\nwith retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our\nanalysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning\nbehaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and\nentropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a\nstrong foundation for RL.

In this\npaper, we hypothesize that instruction following is the missing piece\nunderlying vibe check that represents human preference in coding besides\nfunctional correctness. To quantify models' code instruction following\ncapabilities with measurable signals, we present VeriCode, a taxonomy of 30\nverifiable code instructions together with corresponding deterministic\nverifiers. We use the taxonomy to augment established evaluation suites,\nresulting in Vibe Checker, a testbed to assess both code instruction following\nand functional correctness. Upon evaluating 31 leading LLMs, we show that even\nthe strongest models struggle to comply with multiple instructions and exhibit\nclear functional regression. Most importantly, a composite score of functional\ncorrectness and instruction following correlates the best with human\npreference, with the latter emerging as the primary differentiator on\nreal-world programming tasks. Our work identifies core factors of the vibe\ncheck, providing a concrete path for benchmarking and developing models that\nbetter align with user preferences in coding."}

Inspired by the\nMulti-Store Model in cognitive science, we introduce a memory framework of\nartificial neural networks. Our method maintains a sliding window of the\nTransformer's KV cache as lossless short-term memory, while a learnable module\ntermed Artificial Hippocampus Network (AHN) recurrently compresses\nout-of-window information into a fixed-size compact long-term memory. To\nvalidate this framework, we instantiate AHNs using modern RNN-like\narchitectures, including Mamba2, DeltaNet, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive\nexperiments on long-context benchmarks LV-Eval and InfiniteBench demonstrate\nthat AHN-augmented models consistently outperform sliding window baselines and\nachieve performance comparable or even superior to full-attention models, while\nsubstantially reducing computational and memory requirements. For instance,\naugmenting the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with AHNs reduces inference FLOPs by 40.5%\nand memory cache by 74.0%, while improving its average score on LV-Eval (128k\nsequence length) from 4.41 to 5.88.
