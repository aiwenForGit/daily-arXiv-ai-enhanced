The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints."}

We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split.

Our key idea is to compute a spectral embedding that captures the most fragile directions of the input manifold and to use it to assign a robustness score to each edge or non-edge. Based on these scores, we introduce two complementary attack variants: (i) a Spade-guided deletion attack that removes the most spectrally robust edges, and (ii) a Spade-guided addition attack that inserts edges between nodes that are maximally incompatible in the fragile spectral space.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency."}

Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency.

By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup.

Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

We present a unified framework for certified robust attribution that extends from convex models to deep networks. For convex settings, we derive Wasserstein-Robust Influence Functions (W-RIF) with provable coverage guarantees. For deep networks, we demonstrate that Euclidean certification is rendered vacuous by spectral amplification -- a mechanism where the inherent ill-conditioning of deep representations inflates Lipschitz bounds by over $10{,}000\\times$. This explains why standard TRAK scores, while accurate point estimates, are geometrically fragile: naive Euclidean robustness analysis yields 0\\% certification. Our key contribution is the Natural Wasserstein metric, which measures perturbations in the geometry induced by the model's own feature covariance. This eliminates spectral amplification, reducing worst-case sensitivity by $76\\times$ and stabilizing attribution estimates. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, Natural W-TRAK certifies 68.7\\% of ranking pairs compared to 0\\% for Euclidean baselines -- to our knowledge, the first non-vacuous certified bounds for neural network attribution. Furthermore, we prove that the Self-Influence term arising from our analysis equals the Lipschitz constant governing attribution stability, providing theoretical grounding for leverage-based anomaly detection. Empirically, Self-Influence achieves 0.970 AUROC for label noise detection, identifying 94.1\\% of corrupted labels by examining just the top 20\\% of training data."}

One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach."}

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains."}

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space."}

To address these challenges, we present a framework that enables scalable and energy-efficient PINN training on edge devices. This framework integrates fully quantized training, Stein's estimator (SE)-based residual loss computation, and tensor-train (TT) decomposition for weight compression. It contributes three key innovations: (1) a mixed-precision training method that use a square-block MX (SMX) format to eliminate data duplication during backpropagation; (2) a difference-based quantization scheme for the Stein's estimator that mitigates underflow; and (3) a partial-reconstruction scheme (PRS) for TT-Layers that reduces quantization-error accumulation.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one. Experiments illustrate fast and accurate intent recovery for compliant agents, motivating future work on designing intent-obfuscating controllers."}

This growth in model size has dramatically increased the computational resources required for the training process. Consequently, distributed approaches, such as Federated Learning and Split Learning, have become essential paradigms for scalable deployment. However, existing Split Learning approaches assume client homogeneity and uniform split points across all participants. This critically limits their applicability to real-world IoT systems where devices exhibit heterogeneity in computational resources. To address this limitation, this paper proposes Hetero-SplitEE, a novel method that enables heterogeneous IoT devices to train a shared deep neural network in parallel collaboratively. By integrating heterogeneous early exits into hierarchical training, our approach allows each client to select distinct split points (cut layers) tailored to its computational capacity. In addition, we propose two cooperative training strategies, the Sequential strategy and the Averaging strategy, to facilitate this collaboration among clients with different split points. The Sequential strategy trains clients sequentially with a shared server model to reduce computational overhead. The Averaging strategy enables parallel client training with periodic cross-layer aggregation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and STL-10 datasets using ResNet-18 demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while efficiently supporting diverse computational constraints, enabling practical deployment of collaborative deep learning in heterogeneous IoT ecosystems."}

However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control."}

We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures."}

Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics. Our results indicate that for MILP branching, the computational cost of expressive GNNs currently outweighs their gains in decision quality, suggesting that future research must focus on efficiency-preserving expressivity."}

Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction.

Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning."}

The source code has been released at: https://github.com/qiongwu86/Federated-Distillation-Assisted-Vehicle-Edge-Caching-Scheme-Based-on-Lightweight-DDPM", "summary": "Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage."}

Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands.

Prior work on model extraction has focused on classification models or memorization leakage, leaving the vulnerability of safety-aligned generative medical LLMs underexplored.\n  We present a black-box distillation attack that replicates the domain-specific reasoning of safety-aligned medical LLMs using only output-level access. By issuing 48,000 instruction queries to Meditron-7B and collecting 25,000 benign instruction response pairs, we fine-tune a LLaMA3 8B surrogate via parameter efficient LoRA under a zero-alignment supervision setting, requiring no access to model weights, safety filters, or training data. With a cost of $12, the surrogate achieves strong fidelity on benign inputs while producing unsafe completions for 86% of adversarial prompts, far exceeding both Meditron-7B (66%) and the untuned base model (46%). This reveals a pronounced functional-ethical gap, task utility transfers, while alignment collapses. To analyze this collapse, we develop a dynamic adversarial evaluation framework combining Generative Query (GQ)-based harmful prompt generation, verifier filtering, category-wise failure analysis, and adaptive Random Search (RS) jailbreak attacks. We also propose a layered defense system, as a prototype detector for real-time alignment drift in black-box deployments.\n  Our findings show that benign-only black-box distillation exposes a practical and under-recognized threat: adversaries can cheaply replicate medical LLM capabilities while stripping safety mechanisms, underscoring the need for extraction-aware safety monitoring."}

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers."}

Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions."}

To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code."}

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models."}

By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power.

To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices.

We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers."}

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks."}

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively."}

Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees."}

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models."}

We evaluate three state-of-the-art PLMs-AntiBERTa, BioBERT, and ESM2--against a general-purpose language model (GPT-2) baseline on antibody target specificity prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that while all PLMs achieve high classification accuracy, they exhibit distinct biases in capturing biological features such as V gene usage, somatic hypermutation patterns, and isotype information. Through attention attribution analysis, we show that antibody-specific models like AntiBERTa naturally learn to focus on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while general protein models benefit significantly from explicit CDR-focused training strategies.

By exploiting the structure of factored state spaces, we introduce an exact, search-based algorithm that circumvents the fidelity gaps of surrogate models.

However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

Prior works have shown the possibilities of creating inter-agent cooperation between a group of AVs that follow a social utility. Such altruistic AVs can form alliances and affect the behavior of HVs to achieve socially desirable outcomes. We identify two major challenges in the co-existence of AVs and HVs. First, social preferences and individual traits of a given human driver, e.g., selflessness and aggressiveness are unknown to an AV, and it is almost impossible to infer them in real-time during a short AV-HV interaction. Second, contrary to AVs that are expected to follow a policy, HVs do not necessarily follow a stationary policy and therefore are extremely hard to predict. To alleviate the above-mentioned challenges, we formulate the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose a decentralized framework and reward function for training cooperative AVs. Our approach enables AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, optimizes for a social utility while prioritizing safety and allowing adaptability; robustifying altruistic AVs to different human behaviors and constraining them to a safe action space. Finally, we investigate the robustness, safety and sensitivity of AVs to various HVs behavioral traits and present the settings in which the AVs can learn cooperative policies that are adaptable to different situations."}

The safety and reliability of AVs will depend on their social awareness and their ability to engage in complex social interactions in a socially accepted manner. However, AVs are still inefficient in terms of cooperating with HVs and struggle to understand and adapt to human behavior, which is particularly challenging in mixed autonomy. In a road shared by AVs and HVs, the social preferences or individual traits of HVs are unknown to the AVs and different from AVs, which are expected to follow a policy, HVs are particularly difficult to forecast since they do not necessarily follow a stationary policy. To address these challenges, we frame the mixed-autonomy problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose an approach that allows AVs to learn the decision-making of HVs implicitly from experience, account for all vehicles' interests, and safely adapt to other traffic situations. In contrast with existing works, we quantify AVs' social preferences and propose a distributed reward structure that introduces altruism into their decision-making process, allowing the altruistic AVs to learn to establish coalitions and influence the behavior of HVs."}

Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications."}

Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erdős-Rényi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic Rössler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies.

The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system.

Today's dominant tools trade off speed and flexibility: lexical classifiers (e.g., FastText) are fast but limited to producing classification output scores, while the vector-valued outputs of transformer text embedding models flexibly support numerous workflows (e.g., clustering, classification, and retrieval) but are computationally expensive to produce. We introduce Luxical, a library for high-speed \"lexical-dense\" text embeddings that aims to recover the best properties of both approaches for web-scale text organization. Luxical combines sparse TF--IDF features, a small ReLU network, and a knowledge distillation training regimen to approximate large transformer embedding models at a fraction of their operational cost. In this technical report, we describe the Luxical architecture and training objective and evaluate a concrete Luxical model in two disparate applications: a targeted webcrawl document retrieval test and an end-to-end language model data curation task grounded in text classification. In these tasks we demonstrate speedups ranging from 3x to 100x over varying-sized neural baselines, and comparable to FastText model inference during the data curation task. On these evaluations, the tested Luxical model illustrates favorable compute/quality trade-offs for large-scale text organization, matching the quality of neural baselines.

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution."}

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks."}

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time.

In this work, we introduce the Banach neural operator (BNO) -- a novel framework that integrates Koopman operator theory with deep neural networks to predict nonlinear, spatiotemporal dynamics from partial observations. The BNO approximates a nonlinear operator between Banach spaces by combining spectral linearization (via Koopman theory) with deep feature learning (via convolutional neural networks and nonlinear activations). This sequence-to-sequence model captures dominant dynamic modes and allows for mesh-independent prediction. Numerical experiments on the Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the method's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

For example, energy-based models for protein design are sampled at an artificially low ''temperature'' to generate novel, functional sequences. This temperature tuning is a common yet poorly understood heuristic used across machine learning contexts to control the trade-off between generative fidelity and diversity. Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects. More generally, we characterize how the optimal sampling temperature depends on the interplay between data size and the system's underlying energy landscape. Crucially, our results show that lowering the sampling temperature is not always desirable; we identify the conditions where \\emph{raising} it results in better generative performance. Our framework thus casts post-hoc temperature tuning as a diagnostic tool that reveals properties of the true data distribution and the limits of the learned model."}

Hence, an effective routing system that maps tasks to the appropriate strategies is crucial. Most prior methods build the routing framework by training a single model across all strategies, which demands full retraining whenever new strategies appear and leads to high overhead. Attempts at such continual routing, however, often face difficulties with generalization. Prior models also typically use a single input representation, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of the routing problem and leading to sub-optimal routing decisions. To address these gaps, we propose CONCUR, a continual routing framework that supports both constrained and unconstrained routing (i.e., routing with or without a budget). Our modular design trains a separate predictor model for each strategy, enabling seamless incorporation of new strategies with low additional training cost. Our predictors also leverage multiple representations of both tasks and computation strategies to better capture overall problem complexity. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks show that our method outperforms the best single strategy and strong existing routing techniques with higher end-to-end accuracy and lower inference cost in both continual and non-continual settings, while also reducing training cost in the continual setting."}

We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization.

Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75).

In many real-world problems these conditions fail or cannot be certified, in which case optimal transportation is possible only via stochastic maps that can split mass. To broaden the scope of map estimation theory to such settings, this work introduces a novel metric for evaluating the transportation quality of stochastic maps. Under this metric, we develop computationally efficient map estimators with near-optimal finite-sample risk bounds, subject to easy-to-verify minimal assumptions. Our analysis further accommodates common forms of adversarial sample contamination, yielding estimators with robust estimation guarantees. Empirical experiments are provided which validate our theory and demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in settings where existing theory fails. These contributions constitute the first general-purpose theory for map estimation, compatible with a wide spectrum of real-world applications where optimal transport may be intrinsically stochastic."}

However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules."}

In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks.

Experiments are conducted on classification tasks with two and three classes, as well as on a biomedical dataset.\n  Results indicate that the final self-attention mapping often approximates the OT optimal coupling, yet the training trajectory remains inefficient. Pretraining the MLP section on synthetic data partially improves convergence but is sensitive to their initialization. To address these limitations, an OT-based algorithm is introduced: it generates class-specific dummy Gaussian distributions, computes an OT alignment with the data, and trains an MLP to generalize this mapping. The method achieves accuracy comparable to Transformers while reducing computational cost and scaling more efficiently under standardized inputs, though its performance depends on careful dummy-geometry design.

We introduce a new family of methods that employ beam search to generate candidates for consistency-based UQ, yielding improved performance and reduced variance compared to multinomial sampling. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the beam set probability mass under which beam search achieves a smaller error than multinomial sampling. We empirically evaluate our approach on six QA datasets and find that its consistent improvements over multinomial sampling lead to state-of-the-art UQ performance."}

But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts. In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention. The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. \"Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner\"). Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned. We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told the year is 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1--precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do.

Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$).

I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents."}

Schüle"], "title": "Fast Factorized Learning: Powered by In-Memory Database Systems", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Learning models over factorized joins avoids redundant computations by identifying and pre-computing shared cofactors. Previous work has investigated the performance gain when computing cofactors on traditional disk-based database systems. Due to the absence of published code, the experiments could not be reproduced on in-memory database systems. This work describes the implementation when using cofactors for in-database factorized learning. We benchmark our open-source implementation for learning linear regression on factorized joins with PostgreSQL -- as a disk-based database system -- and HyPer -- as an in-memory engine. The evaluation shows a performance gain of factorized learning on in-memory database systems by 70\\% to non-factorized learning and by a factor of 100 compared to disk-based database systems. Thus, modern database engines can contribute to the machine learning pipeline by pre-computing aggregates prior to data extraction to accelerate training."}

Here, we adapt this idea to supervised learning procedures such as lasso regression and gradient boosting, for tabular data. Our goals are to (1) flexibly fit personalized models for each prediction point and (2) retain model simplicity and interpretability.\n  Our method fits a local model for each test observation by weighting the training data according to attention, a supervised similarity measure that emphasizes features and interactions that are predictive of the outcome. Attention weighting allows the method to adapt to heterogeneous data in a data-driven way, without requiring cluster or similarity pre-specification. Further, our approach is uniquely interpretable: for each test observation, we identify which features are most predictive and which training observations are most relevant. We then show how to use attention weighting for time series and spatial data, and we present a method for adapting pretrained tree-based models to distributional shift using attention-weighted residual corrections. Across real and simulated datasets, attention weighting improves predictive performance while preserving interpretability, and theory shows that attention-weighting linear models attain lower mean squared error than the standard linear model under mixture-of-models data-generating processes with known subgroup structure."}
