In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both\nworlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the\nMINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our\nmethod, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that\nMINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the\npotential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.\nNotably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based\nand actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO\nextensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well\nas discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO\nconsistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and\neffectiveness."}

However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function.

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates\nthat structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,\nand memory-effective MoE LLMs."}

Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses.

Introducing force information\ninto vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,\nbut could also require a lot of data to perform well.

This work highlights the potential of\nquantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural\nmodeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to\nbrain-inspired computing."}

When both the gradient and the Hessian are Lipschitz continuous,\ninstantiating this framework with two different online learners achieves a\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1.75}\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ in the\ndeterministic case and a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ in the\nstochastic case. However, this approach suffers from several limitations: (i)\nthe deterministic method relies on a complex double-loop scheme that solves a\nfixed-point equation to construct hint vectors for an optimistic online\nlearner, introducing an extra logarithmic factor; (ii) the stochastic method\nassumes a bounded second-order moment of the stochastic gradient, which is\nstronger than standard variance bounds; and (iii) different online learning\nalgorithms are used in the two settings. In this paper, we address these issues\nby introducing an online optimistic gradient method based on a novel\n\\textit{doubly optimistic hint function}. Specifically, we use the gradient at\nan extrapolated point as the hint, motivated by two optimistic assumptions:\nthat the difference between the hint and the target gradient remains near\nconstant, and that consecutive update directions change slowly due to\nsmoothness. Our method eliminates the need for a double loop and removes the\nlogarithmic factor. Furthermore, by simply replacing full gradients with\nstochastic gradients and under the standard assumption that their variance is\nbounded by $\\sigma^2$, we obtain a unified algorithm with complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \\sigma^2 \\varepsilon^{-3.5})$, smoothly\ninterpolating between the best-known deterministic rate and the optimal\nstochastic rate."}

We develop a joint bidding\nstrategy that combines participation in the primary frequency reserve market\nwith continuous trading in the intraday market, addressing a gap in the extant\nliterature which typically considers these markets in isolation or simplifies\nthe continuous nature of intraday trading. Our approach utilizes a mixed\ninteger linear programming implementation of the rolling intrinsic algorithm\nfor intraday decisions and state of charge recovery, alongside a learned\nclassifier strategy (LCS) that determines optimal capacity allocation between\nmarkets. A comprehensive out-of-sample backtest over more than one year of\nhistorical German market data validates our approach: The LCS increases overall\nprofits by over 4% compared to the best-performing static strategy and by more\nthan 3% over a naive dynamic benchmark. Crucially, our method closes the gap to\na theoretical perfect foresight strategy to just 4%, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of dynamic, learning-based allocation in a complex, multi-market\nenvironment."}

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing\ninternal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This\nprocess both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token\ngeneration latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs\ncommunicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%\nhigher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text\ncommunication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average\n2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-nics/C2C."}

Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,\nwhich can lead to information loss, we propose to \"combat noise with noise\" by\nleveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing\ninformation loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to\nthe input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them\nbefore mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality.
