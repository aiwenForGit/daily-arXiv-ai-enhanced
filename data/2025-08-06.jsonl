As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on\nbusiness tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense\nreasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,\nenables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves\nadaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics\nand data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning\napproach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in\nreal-world situations."}

Our approach is now\ndeployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating\nonline metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while\nimproving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of\na Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,\ncompute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of\nscaling laws in recommender systems."}

Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}

Existing methods propose separation through generative or\ndiscriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of\ndisentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit\ndisentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing\nseparation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework\nthat learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled\nrepresentations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing.

This paper\npresents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin\nAmerica's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the\nselection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our\napproach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three\nfeature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and\ncontextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly\ncreated collections, we develop content-based representations using item\nembeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We\ntackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and\naddress visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases\nin production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through\nextensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our\nA/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase\nin overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,\nour offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,\nenabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this\nis the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food\ncollections in a dynamic commercial environment."}

In\ncontrast, today, commercial multi-accelerator compute servers that are\nworkhorses of ML, use electrical interconnects to network accelerator chips in\nthe server. However, recent trends have shown an interconnect bandwidth wall\ncaused by accelerator FLOPS scaling at a faster rate than the bandwidth of the\ninterconnect between accelerators in the same server. This has led to\nunder-utilization and idling of GPU resources in cloud datacenters. We develop\nMorphlux, a server-scale programmable photonic fabric, to interconnect\naccelerators within servers. We show that augmenting state-of-the-art photonic\nML-centric datacenters with Morphlux can improve the bandwidth of tenant\ncompute allocations by up to 66% and reduce compute fragmentation by up to 70%.\nWe develop a novel end-to-end hardware prototype of Morphlux to demonstrate\nthese performance benefits, which translate to 1.72x improvement in training\nthroughput of ML models. By rapidly programming the server-scale fabric in our\nhardware testbed, Morphlux can logically replace a failed accelerator chip in\n1.2 seconds."}

The latter dynamically adapts to\nthe job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network\nbandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has\nin common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and\nto the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,\nusing OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level\noptimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML\ncontext. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem."}

Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with\nagent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves\ncomplete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless\nintegration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using\nframeworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from\nscratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as\nMarkov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a\nhierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment\nmodule, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into\ntraining transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such\nas multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we\nintroduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent\nobservability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent\nfinetuning interface.

In this\nwork, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve\na counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the\ninstitution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual\nexplanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,\ninformation-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of\nprivate counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that\nkeeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the\ninstitution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the\namount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,\ncompared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability\nof all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the\nuser retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of\ntheir features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their\nfeature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we\npropose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,\nbut ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and\nI-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their\nattributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we\npresent numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the\ndatabase leakage of the proposed schemes."}
