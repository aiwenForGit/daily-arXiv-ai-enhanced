However,\nexisting approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking\nfrequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance\naccording to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from\na new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that\ntime-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency\ncomponents of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and\ndegraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier\nDiffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and\nhigh-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each\ncomponent, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention\nmechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency\ninteraction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate\nthat WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,\nmore stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing\nmethods."}

The paper\nexplores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in\nthe global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML\nsystems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the\nsophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these\nchallenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link\nanalysis using deep learning techniques.

All data used in this study were generated\nin-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired\nsamples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and\ncardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup,\nresulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was\nemployed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After\npreprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised\nlearning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT),\nand Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were\ntrained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing\nmodels, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test\naccuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that\nlow-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with\nadvanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable\nreliable identification and quality control of organic compounds."}

A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search\nwith Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of\ngeneralization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension.

Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase\nwith distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling.\nSensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a\nrepresentative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is\nonly marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases.

To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based\ndenoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new\nstatistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can\nbe partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification,\n(2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can\nachieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based\nobjective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable\nfaster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically\ndemonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings\nto create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional\n(CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major\nbenchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our\nMoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML\ndenoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise\nsettings.

A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the\nhigh-frequency components of normal background activity.

An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead\ninto multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative\nmethods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space\ngap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the\nquestion of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG\nalignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches\nthe goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a\nsimple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial\ninfarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data\naugmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead\nECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in\nthe latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing\ntransformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation,\nexplicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation\ncapable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal.\nExperimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models\nacross nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler\narchitecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the\nefficacy of direct latent space alignment.

We propose SpellerSSL, a\nframework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to\naddress these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance\nSNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D\nU-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG\ndata. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight\nERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned\nrepresentations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time\ndemonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly\nreduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across\nsubjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG\nrepresentations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a\nstate-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and\nthe highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public\nII-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the\nrequired calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character\nrecognition rate.

Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)\nbackbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric\nimages, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a\nrandomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of\nusable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,\nsemantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves\nstrong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,\nand the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate\nthat OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a\nflexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe\nOmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation\npolicies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation\nmodels. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its\ncheckpoints and training code on our project page."}

Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal\nthree key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial\ninteraction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate\ntrajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;\nand (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,\nopen-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and\ntransferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of\nreward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and\nestablish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric\nagentic models.

Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation\nenvironments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on\nsimplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that\ndo not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change\nprediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the\npractical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often\nunder-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction\nthrough a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights\nthat emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical\nchallenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational\nconstraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these\nexperiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar\npipelines."}

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the\ncue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we\npropose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through\nsystematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the\nconfounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks\nunder controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently\ntexture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,\nthis reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies\nor architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across\ncomputer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance\npatterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,\nmedical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a\nstronger reliance towards texture.

We start formulating the\ncontrol problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the\nmathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The\nassociate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations\ncombining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The\nregression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs),\nexploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are\nintroduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our\nvalue function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and\nrigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze\nhow this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a\nrelatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate\nhow our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing\nof American options."}

Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": "Accepted by Tenth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT25)", "summary": "We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine\ntranslation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and\nanalyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics\ngenerally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more\nstrongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly,\nwe find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that\nthe standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over\nfluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the\ncomposition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control\nthis bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in\nmeta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this\ntradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings."}

Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings\nwith experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various\nbaselines."}

VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint\ntracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with\na task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual\nand proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the\nlow-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.\nVisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in\nsimulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of\nloco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and\nkicking.
