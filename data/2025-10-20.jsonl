Despite their ubiquity, the scientific\nmachine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to\ninvestigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we\nargue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural\nnonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz\nmethod. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from\npath planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an\nexhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising\napplication of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML\nresearch."}

Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men\nStudy (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,\nStage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to\nestimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived\nfeatures for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal\nand external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across\ncohorts.

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B).

OffSim\njointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward\nfunction to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned\nreward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a\npolicy offline without further interaction with the real environment.\nAdditionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a\nmarginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive\nMuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance\ngains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and\nrobustness."}

These methods face the\n`scale-problem' of clustering: when dealing with the MNIST dataset, do we want\nto distinguish different digits or do we want to distinguish different ways of\nwriting the digits? The answer is task dependent and depends on scale. We\nrevisit an idea of Robinson & Pierce-Hoffman that exploits an underlying\nscaling symmetry in t-SNE to replace 2-dimensional with (2+1)-dimensional\nembeddings where the additional parameter accounts for scale. This gives rise\nto the t-SNE tree (short: tree-SNE). We prove that the optimal embedding\ndepends continuously on the scaling parameter for all initial conditions\noutside a set of measure 0: the tree-SNE tree exists. This idea conceivably\nextends to other attraction-repulsion methods and is illustrated on several\nexamples."}

Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human\nlanguages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this\nevaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to\nvalidate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to\ncorrelate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,\nwhich are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis\nsuggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early\nstages of learning to translate."}

However,\nexisting CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited\ncontrollability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the\nresponsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight\nDisentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual\nfeatures into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By\nintroducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method\nimproves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more\ntransparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,\noutperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification\nperformance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a\nfundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of\ninterpretable AI."}

Given the inherent uncertainty and variability in renewable\ngeneration, probabilistic forecasts have become essential for informed\noperational decisions. However, such forecasts frequently suffer from\ncalibration issues, potentially degrading decision-making performance. Building\non recent advances in Conformal Predictions, this paper introduces a tailored\ncalibration framework that constructs context-aware calibration sets using a\nnovel weighting scheme. The proposed framework improves the quality of\nprobabilistic forecasts at the site and fleet levels, as demonstrated by\nnumerical experiments on large-scale datasets covering several systems in the\nUnited States. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves\nhigher forecast reliability and robustness for renewable energy applications\ncompared to existing baselines."}

Those that\ndo exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on\nregular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically\nhigh-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often\nconfined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account.\nFor invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation\nconstraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer\nsecures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous\nfunctions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we\ndemonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the\nsharper criterion of $\\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with\nsufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers,\nequivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable\nregime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for\nshallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive\nmechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that\nsubsumes and extends earlier specialized results."}

A central question in this setting is how to\neffectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter\ninference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in\nscore-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a\ncompositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within\nthe diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of\nindividual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of\nobservations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the\nGAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its\nmean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number\nof observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,\nwhere all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form."}
