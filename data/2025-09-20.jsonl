To address these limitations, we propose a\nhybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based\ndirect equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural\nnetwork into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step\nequation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,\nwhile higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual\nupdates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nthe Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both\nhierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning\nwith minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive\ndecision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances\nscalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of\nsustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate\nthat our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high\nmodel performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time\nadaptation in energy-constrained environments."}

Overall, the present study represents the synthesis of 140\npublications on different types of toxic content on digital platforms. We\npresent a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in previous studies\nfocusing on definitions, data sources, challenges, and machine learning\napproaches employed in detecting online toxicity, such as hate speech,\noffensive language, and harmful discourse. The dataset encompasses content in\n32 languages, covering topics such as elections, spontaneous events, and\ncrises. We examine the possibility of using existing cross-platform data to\nimprove the performance of classification models. We present the\nrecommendations and guidelines for new research on online toxic consent and the\nuse of content moderation for mitigation. Finally, we present some practical\nguidelines to mitigate toxic content from online platforms."}

It is challenging to procure such data from real\nsources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create\nrepetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation\nprocess. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization.\nTools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook\nvaluable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also\nimpractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in\ncommercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges,\nwe propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is\ncapable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets\nfor training TTS models.

Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5\nSonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing\naccuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual\nexperts.

Due to the high\ncomputational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization\nalgorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods.\nHowever, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency\nseismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and\nobserved data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In\nsuch cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local\noptimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion\nresults. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization\nproblem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with\na relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local\noptimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which\nallows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer. Consequently,\nafter training for several thousand iterations, we can obtain a neural network\nmodel with strong generative capability. In this study, we also employ\ngradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate for FWI.\nResults from both synthetic and field data experiments show that FWI may\ninitially converge to a local minimum; however, with sufficient additional\niterations, the inversion can gradually approach the global minimum, slowly\nfrom shallow subsurface to deep, ultimately yielding an accurate velocity\nmodel. Furthermore, numerical examples indicate that, given sufficient\niterations, reasonable velocity inversion results can still be achieved even\nwhen low-frequency data below 5 Hz are missing."}

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful\ntool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world\ntends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies\nacross different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a\nmethod, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque\nfeatures from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect\nanomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)\non four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better\nperformance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method\nof parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and\ndemonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several\nforceful tool use experiments."}

We\nfocus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical\nimages are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle\nthis, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills\nknowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from\nscratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models\nusing pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning\nrate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and\nunlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction\naccuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate\npseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nthirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different\nsettings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,\nallowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its\nadaptability as more advanced models emerge.

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising\nalternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we\nidentify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window\nproblem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become\nirrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address\nthis issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and\nbidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To\novercome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based\nmethod that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to\nbetter fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based\nFine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at\npositions far from context.

To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions.
