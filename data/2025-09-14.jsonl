Peering\noffers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often\ninvolves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection\ncan enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of\npublicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that\ncan predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public\ndatabases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we\nevaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting\npeering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.\nAmong these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and\nefficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly\navailable data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in\npredicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great\nresilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that\nISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection\nprocess, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet\necosystem."}

However, these algorithms typically\nanalyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single\nenvironmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic\nmicrobial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from\ndifferent environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial\ncommunities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological\nconditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating\nboth spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed\npublicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time\npoints, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations\nusing our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates\nalgorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same\nenvironmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from\nmultiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of\nconventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not\nentirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network\ninference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing\nrelevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard\napproaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser\ngenerates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results\ndemonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing\nalgorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments\n(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in\ncross-environment (All) scenarios."}

Drawing on theories of\nthe power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices\ncentralise control over knowledge production and governance within already\ninfluential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment\nthrough three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.\nFurthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the\ncontext-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these\nfeatures in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:\n(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in\ndecentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these\nstrategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with\napplying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper\npositions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic\ninjustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that\nthese strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes."}

However, the\nphysical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,\nrestricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this\nwork, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework\nto accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.\nWe train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber\ncontraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from\ncine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function\ncomposed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the\nwarped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of\ncardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the\ndirection of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network\nimproves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a\nsynthetic phantom experiment.

This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction.
