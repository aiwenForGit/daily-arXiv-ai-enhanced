Although early intervention and customized educational strategies\nare critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and\naddressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic\nchildren prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the\nfoundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite\nto improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor\nemotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding\nof the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in\nthe Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.\nThrough a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a\ntargeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to\nmeet these identified needs.

Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are\nwell-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby\nimproving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN\narchitecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific\ncomponents at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic\nalgorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural\nsolution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook\nmodality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware\ncooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture\nsearch, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative\nco-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a\ncoordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific\ngene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator\nreassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively\ncaptures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we\nintroduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce\nevaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution.

Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair\ntreatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and\nindividual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level\ndefinitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we\nprovide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral\ndomain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an\noptimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from\nstationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many\nexisting ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of\ngraph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly\nencourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus\nmore flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding\na conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our\nanalysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.\nWe evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate\nits effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of\nFairSpecTemp."}

To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian.

Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20).

To\naddress this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that\nhandles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is\nbased on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model\ntrained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy\nfor selecting when to query the enriched model.

This removes spatial context, discards\nanatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid.\nWe introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI\nactivity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat\nvector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit\nfunction: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI\nspace, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation\ndecouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary\nspatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the\nmodel in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses:\n(1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns;\nmodeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data\nefficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data\nacross individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned\non new subjects.

We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and\nseverity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and\nIH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose\nPosterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that\nmitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial\naudio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio\nafter masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments\non several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models\nsuffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence\nand duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and\nin some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and\ntemporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define,\nsystematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination,\npaving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models."}

In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not.

Our architecture combines a\nconvolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables\nefficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality\nrelative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers\nboth clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales."}
