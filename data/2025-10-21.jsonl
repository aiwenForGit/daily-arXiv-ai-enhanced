Along\nthe way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness\nproperties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize\nthe level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct\na large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a\nwildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported\nby our system outperform those who play on their own by $\\sim$$30$% and the AI\nagent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely\noutperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the\ndata gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source\nimplementation of our system at\nhttps://github.com/Networks-Learning/narrowing-action-choices ."}

However, existing methods ignore the compute\nbudget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of\ncompute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can\nconsistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying\nbudgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to\ndata-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements\non data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this\nend, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method\nand naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the\ninner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget\non some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data\nselection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in\naddressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:\nthe expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the\ncomputational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To\nsolve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy\nand compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To\naddress the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into\na penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to\nestimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,\nsignificantly improving efficiency.

Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks.

Our framework captures multi-scale\ntemporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and\nspatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through\nneural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with\nstructural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four\nmechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.\nCritically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied\npost-hoc.\n  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events\nwith 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley\nBank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert\nweight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48\n(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism\nidentification without labeled supervision."}

This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal\nacross all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of\ncombinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\\log d \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{d}$--for\nwhich this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by\na factor of exactly $\\sqrt{\\log d}$.

We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming.

Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult\nbecause of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep\ngenerative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in\npeptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a\ncontinuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to\ngreat effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of\ninterpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a\nsearch space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design\nspace via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the\ninterpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with\nphysicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing\nantimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via\ndimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with\nmore relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality\nreduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the\nlatent space with different physicochemical properties even at different\npercentages of available labels."}

To train a robust model for\nmulti-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various\nmedical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing\nacross institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to\naddress this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect\nof data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large\nnumbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL\nmethod. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating\nclient-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to\ncoordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the\ncontributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,\nwhile the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global\noptimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data\ndistributions.

We compile these insights into a \"Design Suggestion Deck\" that\nsurfaces the most influential layout features and proposes targeted\noptimizations. Experiments on the CircuitNet benchmark demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms existing models on both accuracy and explainability.\nAdditionally, our design suggestion guidance case study and qualitative\nanalyses confirm that the learned preferences align with real-world design\nprinciples and are actionable for engineers. This work highlights the potential\nof MLLMs as interactive assistants for interpretable and context-aware physical\ndesign optimization."}

This approach\ncreates performance ceilings, especially on hardware like the H800 GPU where\nthe primary interconnect's bandwidth can become a bottleneck, and leaves other\nhardware resources like PCIe and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable\nNetwork Interface Cards (NICs) largely idle during intensive workloads. We\npropose FlexLink, the first collective communication framework to the best of\nour knowledge designed to systematically address this by aggregating these\nheterogeneous links-NVLink, PCIe, and RDMA NICs-into a single, high-performance\ncommunication fabric. FlexLink employs an effective two-stage adaptive load\nbalancing strategy that dynamically partitions communication traffic across all\navailable links, ensuring that faster interconnects are not throttled by slower\nones. On an 8-GPU H800 server, our design improves the bandwidth of collective\noperators such as AllReduce and AllGather by up to 26% and 27% over the NCCL\nbaseline, respectively.

Finally, a\ndisjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications\nreveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when\nanalyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach\nindependently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure\nwithout prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g.,\nbiological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a\npowerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a\nhigh-level overview of scientific progress."}

The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our\nfindings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,\nPreference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT).

In addition to compromising the model performance,\nwe demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can\nbe applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP\nwas developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully\ndegrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation\nmodels - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a\ndedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,\nbut rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation\nmodels and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various\nstate-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a\nsignificant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications\nto the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these\npotent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model\nrobustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and\npotentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure\nthe safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology."}

In this work, we focus\non data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation\ntasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,\nand single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With\nour data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family\nof 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative\nrejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges\nlarger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for\nopen-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static\nbenchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,\nFARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,\nFARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.\nstring-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned\nFARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality."}

Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable\ncode, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent\ntechnical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches\ntend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured\nknowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To\novercome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a\nmodular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical\ninsights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from\nscientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two\ndifferent LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on\nPaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible\nsolution for automated AI research replication.

Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a\nframework that renders long texts into images and processes them with\nvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph."}
