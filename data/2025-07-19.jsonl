One\nof them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data\ndistribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the\nfusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing\nattention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we\npropose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the\ngeneration of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the\nfeature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept\ndrift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new\nconcept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to\navoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a\nstrategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make\nthem more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing\ntime of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly\nremove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing\nconcerns that may occur in data streams.

To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

Yet, the crucial task\nof out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We\npropose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and\nnaturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they\nhave shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle\nunder distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of\nTimeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.\nBuilding on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen\npatterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a\ndistinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the\nobserved context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and\nout-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block\nand pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for\nadaptable foundation imputation models."}

Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models\nthat rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics\nfrom the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational\nstructures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring\nintra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nframework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair\nas a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained\nintra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our\nsplit-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for\nlearning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared\nto conventional single-GPU execution."}

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still\nunderperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a\nmulti-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS\ntiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75.
