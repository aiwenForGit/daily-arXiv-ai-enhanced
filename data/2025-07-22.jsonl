This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems.

We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored\nto scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device\nheterogeneity.

Therefore, this\nproject attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals\nexperiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks\nare derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG\nchannels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the\nmajor brain wave frequency bands.

The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate\nmodels, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping\nneural networks.

We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this\napproach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the\nimportance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated\nsamples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on\nthe low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by\nGoogle Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B.

The proposed approach\nleverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence\nof individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a\nlarge proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to\nuncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to\nsignificantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed\nonly for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction\nuncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for\nposterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and\naccuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator\nnetworks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens\nto hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can\neffectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the\noperator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in\nhypersonic flow."}

In scenarios characterized by low\nsimulation efficiency and high costs of raw data acquisition, key challenges\nsuch as surrogate modeling, failure probability estimation, and parameter\ninference are systematically restructured within the Bayesian experimental\ndesign framework.

Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images.

By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.
