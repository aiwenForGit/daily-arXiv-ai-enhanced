However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput.

This study presents the first application of supervised machine\nlearning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar\ngeometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary\nelectron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -\nincluding Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting\n(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the\ntime-averaged electron growth rate, ${\\delta}_{avg}$.

Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs\nin generalizing across disjoint material domains.

In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is\npresented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using\natomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a\nhigh-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,\nand symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to\nexpose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,\nunsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous\natoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with\nmultidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a\nminimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various\ntests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only\nthree order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.\nBased on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as\nthe logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal\nthroughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance\n(AUC).

Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse\nmanipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability\nand generalization.

Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets."}

While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have\ndemonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report\nsummarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications\nremain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,\nregulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the\nemergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models\nexplicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview\nof FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language\nFoundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models\n(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We\nreview their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world\napplications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data\navailability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and\noffer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves\nas both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical\nroadmap for future innovation.

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations.

Existing dataset pruning techniques are\nlargely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these\nmethods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where\ncaptions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate\nrepresentations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework\nspecifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.\nInstead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning\ncaptions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the\nsynthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by\ninitially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We\nthen apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best\nimage by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via\nimage-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC\nconsistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models\non standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in several scenarios.
