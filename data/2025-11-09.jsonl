In contrast to conventional\nevent-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as\na general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into\ndifferent tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists\nof a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,\nconsequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.\nIn this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems\nand study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth\nallocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning\nlatency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the\ngradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the\nobtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio\nand wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under\na given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless\nbandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The\nsimulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost\nby 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level."}

Hybrid 2D radar-based\nmethods discard crucial vertical information, preventing accurate\nreconstruction of height-dependent dynamics. We introduce a gray-box, fully\nthree-dimensional nowcasting framework that directly processes volumetric radar\nreflectivity and couples physically constrained neural operators with\ndatadriven learning.

Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients.

Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods.

Mapping\nmethods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among\nobjects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical\nsoftware supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at\na single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships\nevolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework\nEvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts\ntraditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports\nmultiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling\n(MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).\nIt also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result\nevaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications.\nThis paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes\nthe architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application\nthrough an extensive usage example."}

We propose to apply an existing latent variable model to real-world\nAD data, inferring a pseudotime that orders patients along a data-driven\ndisease trajectory independent of chronological age, then learning how causal\nrelationships evolve. Pseudotime outperformed age in predicting diagnosis (AUC\n0.82 vs 0.59). Incorporating minimal, disease-agnostic background knowledge\nsubstantially improved graph accuracy and orientation. Our framework reveals\ndynamic interactions between novel (NfL, GFAP) and established AD markers,\nenabling practical causal discovery despite violated assumptions."}

In this article we develop an ODE based method to\nstudy the Adam optimizer in a fast-slow scaling regime. For fixed momentum\nparameters and vanishing step-sizes, we show that the Adam algorithm is an\nasymptotic pseudo-trajectory of the flow of a particular vector field, which is\nreferred to as the Adam vector field. Leveraging properties of asymptotic\npseudo-trajectories, we establish convergence results for the Adam algorithm.\nIn particular, in a very general setting we show that if the Adam algorithm\nconverges, then the limit must be a zero of the Adam vector field, rather than\na local minimizer or critical point of the objective function.\n  In contrast, in the overparametrized empirical risk minimization setting, the\nAdam algorithm is able to locally find the set of minima. Specifically, we show\nthat in a neighborhood of the global minima, the objective function serves as a\nLyapunov function for the flow induced by the Adam vector field. As a\nconsequence, if the Adam algorithm enters a neighborhood of the global minima\ninfinitely often, it converges to the set of global minima."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.LG", "cs.MA"], "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)\npipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic\nDark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for\na forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model\nbased on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one\nmillion self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.\nLeveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural\nnetworks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn\nlow-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with\ntarget parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation\nof the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter\nspace spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias\nparameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear\nbias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference\npipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic\ncontaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.\nOur forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter\nconstraints, achieving $2-3\\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\\Omega_m -\nS_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and\neffectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for\nupcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys."}
