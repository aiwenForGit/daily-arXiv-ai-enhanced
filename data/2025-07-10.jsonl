This study proposes an\nAI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk\nidentification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.\nUsing a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG)\nfrom 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance\nviolations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as\naudit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches,\nemployee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and\nAI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three\nalgorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex\nclassification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional,\nnonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based\nlearning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation\nand evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the\nbest performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud\nand compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency,\npast violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The\nstudy recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via\nengineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research\ncontributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent\nauditing and risk management in modern enterprises."}

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a\ndetailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting\ntrade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the\npromise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting\nfuture work in non-autoregressive language generation."}

Utilizing the PhysioNet2022 dataset, a custom heart\ncycle normalization method tailored to individual cardiac rhythms is\nintroduced.

Recent large\nlanguage model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but\neffectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step\nplanning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce\nDeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic\nframework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional\ntemplate-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs\nin a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is\nattempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently\nproposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these\nsuggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks\nbefore the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for\nfurther evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we\ndevelop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human\nchemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This\napproach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product\ncompounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance\nstate-of-art in complex chemical syntheses."}

Real data\ncollection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the\nunique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network\nenvironment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as\nsimulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate\nsite-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there\nis a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality\n(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews\nrecent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital\ntwins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real\ngap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between\ndigital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two\nconceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the\nlevel of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training\nloss via prediction-powered inference."}

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
