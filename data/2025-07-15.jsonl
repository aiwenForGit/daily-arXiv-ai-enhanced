By incorporating these\nbehavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model\nversion to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended\nthrough Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model\ninstances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of\nvarying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive\nvariant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for\nreal-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely\nrepresentational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the\ngroundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over\ntheir own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,\nand adaptive artificial intelligence.

Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies\nduring server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant\ncomputational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL\napproach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph\nlearning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic\nneighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting\nclient models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial\nrelationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We\nevaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,\nand show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard\nbaselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques."}

This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's\ndecision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and\npractical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To\nbridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal\nprinciples and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the\ndeployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences\ngained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can\nprovide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while\nmaintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In\nexploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability\ndoctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts\nhave evaluated the use of predictive models.

The continual need to update the learner with data arriving\nsequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and\nBayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the\nprior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the\nknowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings\nof Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning.

To combat the heavy-tailed\nnoise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming\nnonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth\ncounterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the\nrate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments\nand a symmetric probability density function (PDF). Crucially, N-SGD has\nexponentially decaying tails, matching the performance of linear SGD under\nlight-tailed noise. To handle non-symmetric noise, we propose two novel\nestimators, based on the idea of noise symmetrization. The first, dubbed\nSymmetrized Gradient Estimator (SGE), assumes a noiseless gradient at any\nreference point is available at the start of training, while the second, dubbed\nMini-batch SGE (MSGE), uses mini-batches to estimate the noiseless gradient.\nCombined with the nonlinear framework, we get N-SGE and N-MSGE methods,\nrespectively, both achieving the same convergence rate and exponentially\ndecaying tails as N-SGD, while allowing for non-symmetric noise with unbounded\nmoments and PDF satisfying a mild technical condition, with N-MSGE additionally\nrequiring bounded noise moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$.

We challenge this paradigm by proposing\nConsistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage\ngenerative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency\nmodels to train a VAE architecture. The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive\nseries of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels,\nmirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models.

To address these challenges, we introduce Random\nMapping and Random Projection (RMRP). This method constructs a lightweight\nlinear parametric map by first mapping data to a high-dimensional space,\nfollowed by a sparse random projection for dimensionality reduction. Our novel\nResidual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this\nprocess, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this\nmap, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)\nframework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance\nField (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to\nrefine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a\nclosed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP\nmodel's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive\nnavigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form\ngradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in\ndiverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in\ntime, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe\nnavigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster\ncommunity collaboration."}

While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic\nsettings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional\nresponse distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this\npaper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to\nefficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic\nsimulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach\nbuilds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the\nconditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter\ngeneralized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no\naccess to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple\nreplications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM\nthrough synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake\napplication. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the\nsame cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly\nreduced cost."}
