By incorporating these\nbehavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model\nversion to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended\nthrough Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model\ninstances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of\nvarying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive\nvariant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for\nreal-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely\nrepresentational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the\ngroundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over\ntheir own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,\nand adaptive artificial intelligence.

In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced\nmethods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while\nrequiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters.

This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's\ndecision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and\npractical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To\nbridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal\nprinciples and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the\ndeployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences\ngained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can\nprovide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while\nmaintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In\nexploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability\ndoctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts\nhave evaluated the use of predictive models.

The continual need to update the learner with data arriving\nsequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and\nBayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the\nprior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the\nknowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings\nof Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning.

To combat the heavy-tailed\nnoise, a general black-box nonlinear framework is considered, subsuming\nnonlinearities like sign, clipping, normalization and their smooth\ncounterparts. Our first result shows that nonlinear SGD (N-SGD) achieves the\nrate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/2})$, for any noise with unbounded moments\nand a symmetric probability density function (PDF). Crucially, N-SGD has\nexponentially decaying tails, matching the performance of linear SGD under\nlight-tailed noise. To handle non-symmetric noise, we propose two novel\nestimators, based on the idea of noise symmetrization. The first, dubbed\nSymmetrized Gradient Estimator (SGE), assumes a noiseless gradient at any\nreference point is available at the start of training, while the second, dubbed\nMini-batch SGE (MSGE), uses mini-batches to estimate the noiseless gradient.\nCombined with the nonlinear framework, we get N-SGE and N-MSGE methods,\nrespectively, both achieving the same convergence rate and exponentially\ndecaying tails as N-SGD, while allowing for non-symmetric noise with unbounded\nmoments and PDF satisfying a mild technical condition, with N-MSGE additionally\nrequiring bounded noise moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$. Compared to works\nassuming noise with bounded $p$-th moment, our results: 1) are based on a novel\nsymmetrization approach; 2) provide a unified framework and relaxed moment\nconditions; 3) imply optimal oracle complexity of N-SGD and N-SGE, strictly\nbetter than existing works when $p < 2$, while the complexity of N-MSGE is\nclose to existing works. Compared to works assuming symmetric noise with\nunbounded moments, we: 1) provide a sharper analysis and improved rates; 2)\nfacilitate state-dependent symmetric noise; 3) extend the strong guarantees to\nnon-symmetric noise."}

We challenge this paradigm by proposing\nConsistency Training of Variational AutoEncoders (CoVAE), a novel single-stage\ngenerative autoencoding framework that adopts techniques from consistency\nmodels to train a VAE architecture. The CoVAE encoder learns a progressive\nseries of latent representations with increasing encoding noise levels,\nmirroring the forward processes of diffusion and flow matching models. This\nsequence of representations is regulated by a time dependent $\\beta$ parameter\nthat scales the KL loss. The decoder is trained using a consistency loss with\nvariational regularization, which reduces to a conventional VAE loss at the\nearliest latent time. We show that CoVAE can generate high-quality samples in\none or few steps without the use of a learned prior, significantly\noutperforming equivalent VAEs and other single-stage VAEs methods.

Our novel\nResidual Energy Preservation Theorem provides theoretical guarantees for this\nprocess, ensuring critical geometric properties are preserved. Based on this\nmap, we propose the RPATR (Robust Perception-Aware Trajectory Planner)\nframework. For UAVs, our method unifies grid and Euclidean Signed Distance\nField (ESDF) maps. The front-end uses an analytical occupancy gradient to\nrefine initial paths for safety and smoothness, while the back-end uses a\nclosed-form ESDF for trajectory optimization. Leveraging the trained RMRP\nmodel's generalization, the planner predicts unobserved areas for proactive\nnavigation. For UGVs, the model characterizes terrain and provides closed-form\ngradients, enabling online planning to circumvent large holes. Validated in\ndiverse scenarios, our framework demonstrates superior mapping performance in\ntime, memory, and accuracy, and enables computationally efficient, safe\nnavigation for high-speed UAVs and UGVs. The code will be released to foster\ncommunity collaboration."}

We say that a normalized matrix has a density\n$\\gamma$ if there exists a constant $\\rho > 0$ such that one row or column has\nexactly $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ entries with values at least $\\rho$, and every\nother row and column has at least $\\lceil \\gamma n \\rceil$ such entries.\n  For the upper bound, we show that the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm produces a\nnearly doubly stochastic matrix in $O(\\log n - \\log \\varepsilon)$ iterations\nand $\\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time for all nonnegative square matrices whose\nnormalized version has a density $\\gamma > 1/2$. Such matrices cover both the\nalgorithm's principal practical inputs and its typical theoretical regime, and\nthe $\\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ runtime is optimal.\n  For the lower bound, we establish a tight bound of\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(n^{1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right)$ iterations for positive\nmatrices under the $\\ell_2$-norm error measure. Moreover, for every $\\gamma <\n1/2$, there exists a matrix with density $\\gamma$ for which the algorithm\nrequires $\\Omega\\left(n^{1/2}/\\varepsilon\\right)$ iterations.\n  In summary, our results reveal a sharp phase transition in the Sinkhorn-Knopp\nalgorithm at the density threshold $\\gamma = 1/2$."}
