This transition raises\nconcerns leading to specific requirements for these systems - among them, the\nrequirement that they are designed to behave ethically. Crucially, research\ndirected toward building agents that fulfill the requirement to behave\nethically - referred to as artificial moral agents(AMAs) - has to address a\nrange of challenges at the intersection of computer science and philosophy.\nThis study explores the development of reason-based artificial moral agents\n(RBAMAs). RBAMAs are build on an extension of the reinforcement learning\narchitecture to enable moral decision-making based on sound normative\nreasoning, which is achieved by equipping the agent with the capacity to learn\na reason-theory - a theory which enables it to process morally relevant\npropositions to derive moral obligations - through case-based feedback. They\nare designed such that they adapt their behavior to ensure conformance to these\nobligations while they pursue their designated tasks. These features contribute\nto the moral justifiability of the their actions, their moral robustness, and\ntheir moral trustworthiness, which proposes the extended architecture as a\nconcrete and deployable framework for the development of AMAs that fulfills key\nethical desiderata.

Using ChatBattery, we successfully identify, synthesize, and\ncharacterize three novel lithium-ion battery cathode materials, which achieve\npractical capacity improvements of 28.8%, 25.2%, and 18.5%, respectively, over\nthe widely used cathode material, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811). Beyond this\ndiscovery, ChatBattery paves a new path by showing a successful LLM-driven and\nreasoning-based platform for battery materials invention.

To address these challenges, we introduce a benchmark framework for\nmulti-objective portfolio optimization (MPO) using gradient descent with\nautomatic differentiation. Our method supports any optimization objective, such\nas minimizing risk measures (e.g., CVaR) or maximizing Sharpe ratio, along with\nrealistic constraints, such as tracking error limits, UCITS regulations, or\nasset group restrictions. We have evaluated our framework across six\nexperimental scenarios, from single-objective setups to complex multi-objective\ncases, and have compared its performance against standard solvers like CVXPY\nand SKFOLIO. Our results show that our method achieves competitive performance\nwhile offering enhanced flexibility for modeling multiple objectives and\nconstraints. We aim to provide a practical and extensible tool for researchers\nand practitioners exploring advanced portfolio optimization problems in\nreal-world conditions."}

Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual\nChain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf\nvisual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack\nof high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a\ndiverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent\ninterleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks\nwhere sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific\nquestions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks\nlike visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D\nmulti-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and\nstrategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT\ntraining corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and\nyields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.\nFine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved\nvisual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing\nmultimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to\nsupport development and evaluation of visual CoT."}

B-cos\nnetworks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a\nweight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,\nclass-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining\ndiagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos\nmodels suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making\nthem unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. Additionally, the\noriginal B-cos formulation is limited to multi-class settings, whereas chest\nX-ray analysis often requires multi-label classification due to co-occurring\nabnormalities. In this work, we address both limitations: (1) we introduce\nanti-aliasing strategies using FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to\nsignificantly improve explanation quality, and (2) we extend B-cos networks to\nsupport multi-label classification. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets\ndemonstrate that the modified $\\text{B-cos}_\\text{FLC}$ and\n$\\text{B-cos}_\\text{BP}$ preserve strong predictive performance while providing\nfaithful and artifact-free explanations suitable for clinical application in\nmulti-label settings.

We introduce the Agentar-Fin-R1\nseries of financial large language models (8B and 32B parameters), specifically\nengineered based on the Qwen3 foundation model to enhance reasoning\ncapabilities, reliability, and domain specialization for financial\napplications. Our optimization approach integrates a high-quality, systematic\nfinancial task taxonomy with a comprehensive multi-layered trustworthiness\nassurance framework. This framework encompasses high-quality trustworthy\nknowledge engineering, multi-agent trustworthy data synthesis, and rigorous\ndata validation governance. Through label-guided automated difficulty-aware\noptimization, tow-stage learning processes, and detailed attribution systems,\nwe achieve substantial improvements in training efficiency. Our models undergo\ncomprehensive evaluation on mainstream financial benchmarks including FinEva,\nFinEval, and FinanceIQ, as well as general reasoning datasets such as MATH-500\nand GPQA. To thoroughly assess real-world deployment capabilities, we\ninnovatively propose the Finova evaluation benchmark, which focuses on\nagent-level financial reasoning and compliance verification.

To\nbridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring\ntruthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific\ntextbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific\ndisciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of\nhigh-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed\nthrough systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection\nmethodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available\nscientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system\ncovering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks,\nincorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate\nevaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve\nsuperior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths\ncompared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train\nLlama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which\nsignificantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average\nperformance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger\nand stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an\nend-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit\nreasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to\ncomplex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system\nframework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via\nreinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate\nembodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards\nbased on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are\ncompressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model\nfor robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on\nembodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct\nenables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction\nbehaviors in complex embodied AI tasks."}
