We\npropose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual\ntime-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron\ntracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned\ngate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to\npreserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,\naddressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a\nvariance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by\nbiological homeostasis.

In\nthis work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of\npseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the\ncone effect in LLM.

It\nleverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary\nsatellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12\nhours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\\deg}\n(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly\noutperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly\nhigher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than\npreviously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse\nregions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.\nValidated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant\nimprovements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions\nskill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model\ngenerates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for\nreal-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google\nSearch. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in\nforecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations\ninto weather forecasting."}

Hence, they struggle to\naddress scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented\nacross the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a\nnovel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and\nvertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry\nacross clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either\nof the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.\nIn addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering\nclients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,\nthereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also\nintroduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that\nprioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We\ntrained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three\nclassification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset\nand a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior\nperformance for both multimodal and unimodal classification.

Fuzzy systems provide\nan alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani\nand Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:\ninterpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression\nmethod that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision\nof TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with\nfuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy\nand explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a\ncomponent similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision\nthrough improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and\nversatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between\ninterpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets\ntested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4\ndatasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best\noverall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to\n19%."}

Here, we present an\ninnovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to\nautomatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the\nvalidity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of\ntwo-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on\ndetailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional\nmachine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a\nneural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,\nsurpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in\nscenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a\nprobabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original\ntest sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver\ndistraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one\ndriver substantially increased the likelihood of \"General Unsafe Driving\";\ndistraction for both drivers maximized the probability of \"Both Drivers Took\nHazardous Actions\"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the\nprobability of \"Speed and Stopping Violations.\" Our framework and analytical\nmethods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated\nDHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and\nintervention."}

Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often\ninduces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true\nobjectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves\nlearning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over\npairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address\nthe limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair\n(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy\nreward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term\nfrom preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that\nare highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only\na few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and\ncorrect for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a\nnew preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a\ncumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based\nRL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR\nconsistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch\nfrom preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,\nrequiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies."}

However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and\nunsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a\ndelay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,\nallowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our\nmethod employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and\nfuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On\nvideo from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic\nsegmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only\nbaselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.\nWithout incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared\nto fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a\nround-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and\nhigher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more\neffectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain\naligned with the current world state."}

To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model\nthat utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and\nhigh-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch\nand fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a\nmulti-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that\nLogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,\nGMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.\nOur smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average\naccuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%\nreduction in GMACs.

This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian\ncovariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal\nestimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural\nM-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime,\nindependent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that\nthis estimator performs very well, and that Tyler's iterative procedure\nconverges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the\nfirst distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as\nthe first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler's iterative procedure.\nHowever, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by\na $\\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold\nand error bounds for Tyler's M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions,\nfully matching the Gaussian result. Moreover, we recover the algorithmic\nconvergence even at this lower sample threshold. Our approach builds on the\noperator scaling connection of Franks and Moitra by introducing a novel\npseudorandom condition, which we call $\\infty$-expansion.

This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations.
