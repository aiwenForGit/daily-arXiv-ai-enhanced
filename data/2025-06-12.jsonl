We investigate this gap between knowledge and\nsampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized\nRejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection\nsampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed\nsamples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS\nsubstantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical\nanalysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct\nsampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More\nbroadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized\nand embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring\naccess to model internals or heavy prompt engineering."}

In this paper, we propose Symbolic\nGraph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and\ngraph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to\nconvert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,\ninteraction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.\nMoreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual\ncorpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,\nour objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a\ntextual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic\nlearning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and\ngenerative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological\ninformation from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and\ncomprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm\nthe superiority of our approach.

In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length\nTraining (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to\nmatch the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and\nSimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their\nstandard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and\noverall improvements across downstream tasks.

Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena\nemerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do\nsimilar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In\nidentifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a\nstraightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this\ncase, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic\nuncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in\nover-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely\nunexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of\nscaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with\nrespect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language\ntasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive\nuncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and\nensemble methods.

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks."}

However, existing\ndiffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image\nrestoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in\ndegraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect\ntext-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In\nthis paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel\nrestoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and\ntextual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale\nbenchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and\ncomplex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion\nframework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion\nmodels into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from\njoint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,\nwhich are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text\nrecognition accuracy.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded\n3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking\ntasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D\ntracking methods."}
