The\ntransformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism\nto draw global dependencies between input and output.

It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives\nthrough a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who\nprovided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,\ncapturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm\ndemographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,\nrevealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that\ndiverge from conventional evaluations.

Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled\ndecision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system\ninteractions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL\nhas generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function\napproximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's\npolicy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify\nthe issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited\ninterpretability in model-free RL.

EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and\nGLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing\nneed for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that\ncapture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.\n  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic\nparameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound\nviews. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on\nKoopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical\nmetadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic\nsequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via\nattention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,\nresulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).\n  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac\npathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the\ncurve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five\nfolds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and\nspecificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based\nanalysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,\nwith optimal discrimination near this threshold.\n  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker\nfor cardiac function.

To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint.

The set of quality data can be expanded\nthrough trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need\nquality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or\nirrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on\ndistributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality\nchecks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose\na distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies\nexternal data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To\nachieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in\nrigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine\nwhether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,\ntermed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary\ncontamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the\nBenjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse\ncollaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness\nof our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes\nitself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous\nquality guarantees."}

Our experiments show that QBMs using our\napproach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of\nsimilarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller\nnumbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique\nleads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM\nexecutions."}

Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments."}
