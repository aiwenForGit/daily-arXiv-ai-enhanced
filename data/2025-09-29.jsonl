This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata\nfor DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and\nfidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that\nexisting approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with\nparameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence\nof task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a\ndata-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our\nkey observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation\nsubspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and\nfidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior\nresponses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby\nensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects\ncomplementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new\ntasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain\nconsistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions.

In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we\nprovably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on\nmissing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles\nplayed by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample\nsizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and\ngeneralization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as\nMuon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our\nanalysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures."}

We argue that progress is\nreal, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,\nevaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt\ncontamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,\nwe show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,\nparity-controlled evaluation.

Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL\nmodels: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand\nsubstantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive\ndatasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased\ndue to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal\nhyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the\ngrowing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently\ngained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a\nsubset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,\nreferred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original\ndataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing\nrandom sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of\nthe original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias\ntowards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has\ninter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class\ndiversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,\nlightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method\nto extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized\nfor the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology\nby conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical\nimaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the\nrandom sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions."}

In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa\ndataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,\nthe brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning\nmodels, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and\ncompared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a\ncomprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such\nas ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the\ndifference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results\ndid not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally\nperformed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not\nsatisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and\nmachine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of\nconsumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the\nmachine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the\nEEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models\nwhich are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks."}

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of\nvision tokens. With the advent of \"thinking with images\" models, reasoning now\nextends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our\ntwo-stage \"coarse-to-fine\" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is\nanalyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are\ncropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This\napproach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual\ndetails where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are\ntruly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first\nstage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where\nclear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this\nissue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs\nreasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to\nfocus.

By training LMs from scratch on a\nsynthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear\nrelational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure\nsubstantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen\nreverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key\nrole in consistent model editing.

Subsequently, in order to reduce the\nreliance on the unknown parameters $\\alpha,\\gamma,\\beta$ inherent in the\n\\texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithm\nnamed \\texttt{MA-MPL}. This \\texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely\n\\emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximation\nratio as the first \\texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \\texttt{MA-SPL}\nand \\texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation technique\ntermed as \\emph{policy-based continuous extension}.

To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And\nReward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable\nmethod that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness\ndata, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the\nmodel itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix\nof objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and\nevaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to\nevaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a\nseparate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a\npositive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better\npolicy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further\nrefine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via\nself-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We\nshow that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM\nmodels and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks.

SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL\nsimulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute\nmargin of 63%.
