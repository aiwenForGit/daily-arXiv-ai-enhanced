T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with\ntwo parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input\ntokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse\ntasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with\nalleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the\ntask and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of\ntask-relevant information.

Vector Quantization (VQ), a\nclustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this\nissue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.\nSince a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction\nand magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.\nHowever, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to\nquantization compared to the magnitude.

We find that language models\nundergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of\nloss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in\nlog-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing\nthe loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of\nloss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type\nof degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,\nper-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive\ninterference in per-example changes in loss.

When no such pairing\nexists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much\nharder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points\nindependently.

We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task\nsimilarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are\nchallenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and\nbeneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular\nSharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm\nthat allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also\nidentifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without\ncoordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three\nmechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine\nsimilarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and\n(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration.

However,\nmost existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,\nfailing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization\nbitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make\nkey assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be\nexpressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat\nformulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose\nclosed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise\nquantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,\nachieving up to 56$\\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large\nlanguage models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters.

A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered\nAI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing\nmonitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them\nill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We\ncontend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient\nand statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative\nto current practices.

Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding\ndepth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using\nregularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the\n$\\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is\nregularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\\ell_2$ norm grows in many\ncases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also\nshow that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any\nother hyperparameter fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\uff09\u8bf1\u5bfc\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6cdb\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff08grokking\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76grokking\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6210\u56e0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u4f46\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u5982\u2113\u2081\u6216\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfcgrokking\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfcgrokking\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0grokking\uff1b\u2113\u2082\u8303\u6570\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u8bf1\u5bfcgrokking\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large\nproportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,\nwhich can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification\nand classification of positive instances.

However, such static datasets often exhibit\ndistribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this\nlimitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which\nleverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising\nresults, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future\ntrajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history\ntransitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders\nthe discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to\ncritical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we\nintroduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework\nfor offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any\nintermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task\ninto two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating\nforward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating\nbackward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can\nefficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially\nvaluable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating\ndataset diversity.

The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been\nproposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work\nthat extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for\npractical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar\nphenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the\ncumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal\nNeural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following\nthree properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to\ntheir within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class\nmeans align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a\none-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to\nlogits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the\nclass order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly\nlocal and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables\nand the threshold values.

In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based\nDisentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed\nto address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete\nwavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and\nhigh-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies\nto each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we\napply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting\nnormalization parameters.

Based on these data, electricity\nsuppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback\non the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates\nhave relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly\nconsumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.\nNon-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a\nhousehold's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power\nfor individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM\nare based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire\nhousehold consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world\nsmart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each\nsegmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper\nintroduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new\nsubsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the\ndistribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only\non the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world\ndatasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.\nOur solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's\n(Electricit\\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed\ninsights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power\nconsumption.

However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to\nsolution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access\nthe broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL\nbased on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,\nobtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded\nthin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to\nsystematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven\napproach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and\nsputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition\ndistribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ\nmeasurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter\nchamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of\nthe sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using\nGaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of\nthe deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of\nthe deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We\ninvestigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully\nBayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best\nperformance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10\nexperiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions\nwas verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by\navoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus\ndemonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials\nexploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u63a7\u5171\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u7d20\u7ec4\u5408\u8584\u819c\u7684\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8584\u819c\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684SDL\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6eb6\u6db2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u63a7\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u6269\u5c55SDL\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec4\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77f3\u82f1\u6676\u4f53\u5fae\u5929\u5e73\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u4f4d\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u8584\u819c\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BALM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u970010\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u6e90\u7684\u6c89\u79ef\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5171\u6e85\u5c04\u6210\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ML\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684SDL\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The gold\nstandard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after\ndeletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This\ndefinition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only\nthe unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \\setminus\nU$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning\nalgorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In\nthis work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to\nprovide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain\naccess to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and\nnot all of $S\\setminus U$.

In deep learning, a significant\nchallenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced\noptimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient\ndescent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process.

The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum.

These\nmethods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient\nascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy\ngradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.\nIndeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve\nefficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as\nprevious gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received\nsubstantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored\nfrom a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous\ntheoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can\nsignificantly accelerate convergence in PG methods.

This paper bridges this\ngap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with\na focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first\nshow that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with\nor without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more\nthan the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also\ncompletely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks\nhave the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We\nthen introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of\nparameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual\nblock, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of\nsuch laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in\nisolation.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning.

Foundation models are large models, trained on broad\ndata that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without\nfine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers\n(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.\nHowever, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces\nsignificant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks.

Experiments conducted on popular\nLLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot\nconsistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by\napproximately 10-30\\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,\nwithout introducing additional inference latency.

Classical model selection\nmethods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the\nstationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo\ngradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,\nand model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To\ntackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence\nsets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the\nevolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a\nconfidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time\nperiod with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity\nof unknown forms.

However, most existing methods make\nrestrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or\nrequire substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we\npropose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed\npartial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging\nthe pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.\nWe prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a\nrestricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based\nalgorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated\nCPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their\nadherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges.

Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational\nlinks between entities in a database and converting the structured data into\nflat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical\nrelational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM\ncontext lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a\ngraph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational\nprompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.\nUnlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves\nthe inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to\neffectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,\nthe GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature\nrepresentations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal\ndependencies.

Temporal\nmisalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state\nestimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are\ncritical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address\nthis problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar\nboth relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor\nfusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor\nstaleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into\na perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple\nLiDARs, radars and cameras.

The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)\ndevice was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32\nimages to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which\nleads to a diagnosis.\n  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected\ninhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate\nwheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by\ndrawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT\ndevice, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a\ncustom-made approach.

Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,\nwe find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token\nprediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also\nextends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on\nMTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference\ntime without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCartridge\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u65f6\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCartridge\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "Cartridge\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0eICL\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e38.6\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad826.4\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Cartridge\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ec4\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Many focus on peripheral,\n``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval\nover deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MF$^2$\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6838\u5fc3\u53d9\u4e8b\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "MF$^2$\u5305\u542b50\u591a\u90e8\u5b8c\u6574\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u6bcf\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u914d\u5bf9\u624b\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u58f0\u660e\u5bf9\uff0c\u5171850\u591a\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6838\u5fc3\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u58f0\u660e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u53d9\u4e8b\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "MF$^2$\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
