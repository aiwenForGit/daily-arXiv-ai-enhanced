Existing\nneural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located\ninput-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in\nreal-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical\nmanifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator\nNetwork (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable\nfunctional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring\nhigh-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron\nmeasurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond\nshared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and\ntarget manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without\niterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator\nlearning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23\nyears of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with\nmillisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle\nfor cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex\nspatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems."}

Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the\nclosed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label\nspaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world\nscenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in\nthe source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised\nopen-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly\nclassify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously\nunseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel\nframework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and\nmodel sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph\nstructure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and\nunknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning\ndomain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while\npreserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.\nAdditionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown\nclass, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set\nrecognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling\nacross space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive\napproaches.

Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task.

This paper presents theoretical results for\noverparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability.\nFirst, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls,\nwe derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension.\nSecond, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly\nprobability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of\nbounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the\nsphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder\nto \"shatter\" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons,\ngradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns\nand thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that\nis easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent\nfavors memorization.

Specifically, we extract rule-based\ndescriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While\nprior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may\nnaturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output\nfeatures, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form\n\"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English\", (2) absence rules of the form\n\"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English,\" and (3) counting rules that toggle only\nwhen the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.\nAbsence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of\nexemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or\nincomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these\ntypes of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.\nWe find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100\nskip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first\nlayer (in over a fourth of features).

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning.

A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance.
