### [1] [KVmix: Gradient-Based Layer Importance-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08018)
*Fei Li,Song Liu,Weiguo Wu,Shiqiang Nie,Jinyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVmix是一种新型混合精度量化方法，用于优化LLM推理中的KV缓存，通过动态分配精度和长上下文优化策略，显著降低内存占用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理中的KV缓存内存需求高，限制了其在资源受限平台上的部署。现有量化方法无法动态分配精度或优化长上下文任务。

Method: KVmix利用梯度重要性分析，动态分配层特定比特宽度，并引入长上下文优化策略，优先保留关键KV对的高精度。

Result: 在Llama和Mistral等LLM上，KVmix实现了接近无损的推理性能，内存压缩4.9倍，推理速度提升5.3倍。

Conclusion: KVmix通过动态混合精度量化和长上下文优化，有效平衡了内存、精度和效率，为LLM部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of
Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in
resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the
memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on
static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize
critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method
for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to
evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model
loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision
quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers
while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable
balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic
long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV
pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving
high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix
provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize
computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves
near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization
configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x
memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半监督方法，将难民的统计数据从行政边界分解到0.5度的网格单元中，覆盖25个撒哈拉以南非洲国家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过高分辨率的数据分析，揭示以往被区域和国家统计数据掩盖的局部流离失所模式。

Method: 结合UNHCR的ProGres注册数据、Google Open Buildings的卫星建筑足迹和OpenStreetMap的地点坐标，使用标签传播算法生成高精度的难民统计数据。

Result: 方法平均准确率达到92.9%，成功将1000多万难民观测数据分配到合适的网格单元。

Conclusion: 高分辨率数据集为深入理解流离失所的驱动因素提供了基础。

Abstract: We present a semi-supervised approach that disaggregates refugee statistics
from administrative boundaries to 0.5-degree grid cells across 25 Sub-Saharan
African countries. By integrating UNHCR's ProGres registration data with
satellite-derived building footprints from Google Open Buildings and location
coordinates from OpenStreetMap Populated Places, our label spreading algorithm
creates spatially explicit refugee statistics at high granularity.This
methodology achieves 92.9% average accuracy in placing over 10 million refugee
observations into appropriate grid cells, enabling the identification of
localized displacement patterns previously obscured in broader regional and
national statistics. The resulting high-resolution dataset provides a
foundation for a deeper understanding of displacement drivers.

### [3] [Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Partial Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08020)
*Zi-Ying Chen,Chuan-Xian Ren,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双层次不平衡最优传输（BUOT）模型，用于解决部分领域自适应（PDA）问题，通过同时表征样本级和类级关系，提升知识转移的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分领域自适应问题需要对齐跨领域样本并识别异常类，现有加权框架仅能表征样本级关系，对异常类的识别不够准确。

Method: 提出BUOT模型，结合样本级和类级传输，通过合作机制提供结构信息和判别信息，并引入标签感知传输成本以提高效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了BUOT的竞争力。

Conclusion: BUOT模型通过双层次传输框架有效解决了部分领域自适应问题，提升了知识转移的准确性。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain
samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge
transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier
classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label
distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights
can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient
exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the
inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle
these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model
to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a
unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between
sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level
transport provides essential structure information for the class-level
knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative
information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan
provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware
transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation
formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

### [4] [FlowBERT: Prompt-tuned BERT for variable flow field prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08021)
*Weihao Zou,Weibing Feng,Pin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）知识迁移的通用流场预测框架，解决了传统计算流体动力学（CFD）方法的高计算成本和现有深度学习模型跨条件迁移能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFD方法计算成本高，而现有深度学习模型在跨条件迁移能力上表现不足，因此需要一种更高效且适应性强的预测框架。

Method: 框架创新性地结合了Proper Orthogonal Decomposition（POD）降维技术和预训练LLM的微调策略，POD用于流场特征的压缩表示，微调模型则学习在状态空间中编码系统动态。此外，设计了流体动力学导向的文本模板以提升预测性能。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在少样本学习场景中优于传统Transformer模型，并在多种流入条件和翼型几何中表现出卓越的泛化能力。与传统Navier-Stokes方程求解器相比，预测时间缩短至秒级且保持90%以上准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为快速流体动力学预测开辟了新方向，潜在应用包括气动优化、流动控制等工程领域。

Abstract: This study proposes a universal flow field prediction framework based on
knowledge transfer
  from large language model (LLM), addressing the high computational costs of
traditional
  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and the limited cross-condition
transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates
Proper Orthogonal
  Decomposition (POD) dimensionality reduction with fine-tuning strategies for
pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while
the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's
adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that
improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot
learning scenarios while
  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and
airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT
architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation,
our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed
knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction,
with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other
engineering domains.

### [5] [Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08022)
*Chenxi Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Ruibo Chen,Yihan Wu,Junfeng Guo,Tianyi Zhou,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MBPO的新偏好学习框架，通过生成硬负样本和在线验证奖励数据，结合GRPO方法，解决多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升性能并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法未有效抑制LLM骨干的内部偏见，且依赖离线数据，无法适应动态分布变化，导致多模态模型在推理中出现模态不平衡问题。

Method: MBPO通过对抗性扰动生成硬负样本构建离线偏好数据集，并利用闭端任务生成在线验证奖励数据，结合GRPO方法训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，MBPO能显著提升多模态模型在视觉语言任务中的性能，并有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MBPO为解决多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题提供了一种有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been
significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent
preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality
imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual
inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes
hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs
do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model
(LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on
offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to
dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified
rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM
alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework,
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality
imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset
by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due
to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of
input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended
tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed
to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging
vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

### [6] [Recipes for Pre-training LLMs with MXFP8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08027)
*Asit Mishra,Dusan Stosic,Simon Layton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在预训练中使用低精度表示（如MX格式）以提高GPU效率的方法，并提出了一种改进的舍入模式以避免模型发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过精度缩放（如MX格式）在不牺牲准确性的情况下提高GPU效率，同时解决实际应用中可能出现的数值稳定性问题。

Method: 提出了一种改进的舍入模式（round-to-infinity）来计算缩放因子，以解决OCP规范中建议的舍入模式导致的模型发散问题。

Result: 在MXFP8格式下，使用改进的舍入模式成功预训练了一个8B参数的模型，数据集规模为15T tokens。

Conclusion: 改进的舍入模式能够有效解决MX格式在预训练中的数值稳定性问题，为低精度预训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and
related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for
improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX)
formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling
this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data
types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to
quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared
to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used
carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token
dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP
specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an
improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling
factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T
tokens.

### [7] [ST-GraphNet: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Understanding and Predicting Automated Vehicle Crash Severity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08051)
*Mahmuda Sultana Mimi,Md Monzurul Islam,Anannya Ghosh Tusti,Shriyank Somvanshi,Subasish Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-GraphNet是一个时空图神经网络框架，用于建模和预测自动驾驶车辆（AV）碰撞严重性，通过细粒度和区域聚合的空间图实现，测试准确率达97.74%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解AV碰撞严重性的时空动态对提升城市交通安全和基础设施规划至关重要。

Method: 使用细粒度和H3空间单元聚合的图表示，结合多模态数据（如文本嵌入），评估多种GNN架构（如GCN、GAT、DSTGCN）。

Result: ST-GraphNet在粗粒度H3图上表现最佳，测试准确率97.74%，显著优于细粒度模型（64.7%）。

Conclusion: 空间聚合、动态消息传递和多模态特征整合能有效捕捉AV碰撞严重性的复杂时空模式。

Abstract: Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV)
crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and
infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV
crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs.
Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from
Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE
automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary
graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as
nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a
coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical
Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal
adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including
semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from
crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various
graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN
(DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our
proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3
graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the
best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the
effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal
feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns
underlying AV crash severity.

### [8] [STAMImputer: Spatio-Temporal Attention MoE for Traffic Data Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08054)
*Yiming Wang,Hao Peng,Senzhang Wang,Haohua Du,Chunyang Liu,Jia Wu,Guanlin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAMImputer是一种用于交通数据填补的时空注意力混合专家网络，通过动态图结构和专家框架解决块缺失和非平稳数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在块缺失数据场景下提取特征效果不佳，静态图结构限制了模型对非平稳交通数据的灵活性。

Method: 提出混合专家框架（MoE）捕获时空特征及其权重，设计低秩引导采样图注意力机制（LrSGAT）动态平衡局部和全局相关性。

Result: 在四个交通数据集上实验，STAMImputer性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STAMImputer有效解决了交通数据填补中的块缺失和非平稳性问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various
applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow
prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to
effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile,
the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly
constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for
the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for
traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence
weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling
Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local
and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are
utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial
correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for
evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance
improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at
https://github.com/RingBDStack/STAMImupter.

### [9] [Eliciting Fine-Tuned Transformer Capabilities via Inference-Time Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08060)
*Asankhaya Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明，通过推理时技术（如上下文学习）可以近似监督微调的能力，无需修改模型参数，并扩展到实际场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少监督微调的计算开销，探索在有限资源和部分数据集访问下的高效模型部署。

Method: 基于理想化假设，利用上下文学习技术，扩展到有限上下文长度和部分数据集访问的实际场景。

Result: 证明了在文本生成和线性分类任务中，所需数据集大小的理论界限。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了理论基础，并通过检索增强生成等技术连接理论与实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper
formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a
base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context
learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions
including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning
dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context
lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output
length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l
\log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate
fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$
is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear
classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon}
\right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log
\frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension.
Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a
theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language
models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging
theory to real-world applications.

*Woosung Kim,Jinho Lee,Jongmin Lee,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairDICE是首个离线多目标强化学习框架，直接优化非线性福利目标，无需显式偏好权重或穷举搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性标量化方法无法捕捉公平导向目标（如Nash社会福利或最大最小公平），而离线环境下非线性福利标准的统一优化方法尚未探索。

Method: FairDICE利用分布校正估计，联合考虑福利最大化和分布正则化，实现稳定且样本高效的学习。

Result: 在多个离线基准测试中，FairDICE表现出优于现有基线的公平感知性能。

Conclusion: FairDICE为离线多目标强化学习中的非线性福利优化提供了有效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in
the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly
used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for
certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such
as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and
non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed
for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear
welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a
fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first
offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective.
FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for
welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and
sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or
exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE
demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

*Songqiao Hu,Zeyi Liu,Xiao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、快速的Lite-RVFL网络，无需检测概念漂移或重新训练即可适应数据分布变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线学习方法因概念漂移导致的可靠性问题，避免高计算成本的重训练和漂移检测。

Method: 引入指数加权新样本的目标函数，强调近期数据，并推导出高效的增量更新规则。

Result: 实验验证了Lite-RVFL在适应漂移和捕捉时间模式上的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: Lite-RVFL是一种适用于实时应用的高效概念漂移适应方法。

Abstract: The change in data distribution over time, also known as concept drift, poses
a significant challenge to the reliability of online learning methods. Existing
methods typically require model retraining or drift detection, both of which
demand high computational costs and are often unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, a lightweight, fast and efficient
random vector functional-link network termed Lite-RVFL is proposed, capable of
adapting to concept drift without drift detection and retraining. Lite-RVFL
introduces a novel objective function that assigns weights exponentially
increasing to new samples, thereby emphasizing recent data and enabling timely
adaptation. Theoretical analysis confirms the feasibility of this objective
function for drift adaptation, and an efficient incremental update rule is
derived. Experimental results on a real-world safety assessment task validate
the efficiency, effectiveness in adapting to drift, and potential to capture
temporal patterns of Lite-RVFL. The source code is available at
https://github.com/songqiaohu/Lite-RVFL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中数据增长带来的标注和训练效率问题，避免传统方法的数据冗余和主动学习的复杂性及偏差。

Method: 利用任务特定模型和开源模型，选择性标注并整合在线和网络数据，优化数据集。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等数据集上，标注和训练成本减少32%，性能无损失；半监督学习下可进一步减少50%标注比例。

Conclusion: Info-Coevolution高效提升数据集质量，降低标注和训练成本，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of
real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and
training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and
data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional
approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training
efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a
subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and
introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework
that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective
annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source
models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve
datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,
Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without
performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without
tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with
semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement
using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种预训练时间序列模型与传统方法在电力价格预测中的表现，发现传统方法（如MSTL）仍具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力价格预测对电力现货市场决策至关重要，但生成式AI和预训练大模型在电力价格预测中的效果尚不明确。

Method: 通过德国、法国、荷兰、奥地利和比利时的2024年日前拍卖电力价格数据，对比了多种预训练模型与传统统计和机器学习方法的表现。

Result: Chronos-Bolt和Time-MoE表现最佳，但MSTL模型在一致性和统计性能上优于所有预训练模型。

Conclusion: 传统方法（如MSTL）在电力价格预测中仍具有优势，预训练模型尚未超越。

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective
decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation
models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains
uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art
pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and
TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for
EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with
a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the
TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL
model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its
consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM
statistically outperforming it.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities,
yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or
redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy,
with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches
introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often
leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL
framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient
reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length
reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens,
and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for
hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and
efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based
reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly
for efficient reasoning.

*Aviad Susman,Mayte Suárez-Fariñas,Joseph T Colonel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NONA的可微分k-NN回归层，通过结合神经网络的注意力机制和传统算法的预测能力，提升了回归任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如k-NN）在特征提取后表现优于神经网络本身，但由于其不可微性和独特优化需求，难以直接融入监督微调（SFT）。

Method: 引入NONA回归层，利用注意力机制和学习的注意力掩码方案，实现k-NN的可微分近似。

Result: 在多个非结构化数据集上，NONA在回归任务中表现优于密集层预测和基于SFT嵌入的k-NN。

Conclusion: NONA为将传统算法融入神经网络提供了一种可行方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction
capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional
algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This
procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a
domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional
predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner,
traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model
itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings
specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense
layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into
SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many
traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due
to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements.
As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors
Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network
attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a
differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple
unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer
prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

Abstract: Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI,
building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data
for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present
AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in
real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding
capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources,
select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and
code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404
coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines
and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the
only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven
scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the
effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid,
and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on
AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show
substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks,
ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches
the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success
rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it
lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative
improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

Abstract: Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In
this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints,
where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as
in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral
clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of
convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable
augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers
type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated
subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational
efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive
eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant
speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size
grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the
adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为异质材料力学性质识别提供了通用且鲁棒的替代方案，优于传统逆向方法。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of
heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a
full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from
digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field
is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to
effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven
method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to
discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary
materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations
by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the
input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based
constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by
minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for
violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and
the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with
several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in
material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material
identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to
experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is
robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous
materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to
classical inverse methods.

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities
acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data
regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there
are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains
unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular
formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads
to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and
retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the
hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem
(which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority
over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical
structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the
lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the
upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new
formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning
(\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but
more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the
state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and
metrics. Codes are available at

Conclusion: UniVarFL是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限的实际联邦学习部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation
when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional
remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur
high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,
we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training
dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model
dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies
during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns
class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,
effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity
Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature
representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability
to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing
methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and
efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in
resource-constrained settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/UniVarFL

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在处理非独立同分布数据时表现有效。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效应对联邦学习中的数据噪声问题。

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages edge
computing on client devices to optimize models while maintaining user privacy
by ensuring that local data remains on the device. However, since all data is
collected by clients, federated learning is susceptible to latent noise in
local datasets. Factors such as limited measurement capabilities or human
errors may introduce inaccuracies in client data. To address this challenge, we
propose the use of a stochastic neural network as the local model within the
federated learning framework. Stochastic neural networks not only facilitate
the estimation of the true underlying states of the data but also enable the
quantification of latent noise. We refer to our federated learning approach,
which incorporates stochastic neural networks as local models, as Federated
stochastic neural networks. We will present numerical experiments demonstrating
the performance and effectiveness of our method, particularly in handling
non-independent and identically distributed data.

Abstract: In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning
has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the
aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the
current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric
counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing
methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a
greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global
model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and
categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper,
we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to
facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate
categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and
regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark
algorithm.

Conclusion: 相关噪声机制通过优化噪声相关性，显著提升了差分隐私在AI和机器学习模型训练中的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise
mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to
private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of
estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject
independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning
algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body
of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the
noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully
canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps.
Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms,
factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when
applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with
industrial deployment at a global scale.

Conclusion: RSG方法能够从有限测量中全面理解残余应力分布，显著降低实验需求。

Abstract: Residual stresses, which remain within a component after processing, can
deteriorate performance. Accurately determining their full-field distributions
is essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However,
the experimental effort required for full-field characterization is
impractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML)
based Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited
measurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing
numerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on
U-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through
systematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate
simulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual
characterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of
simulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and
exhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it
successfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The
RSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights
the feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive
understanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements,
thereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.

Conclusion: 研究为理解集成模型的可解释性提供了更坚实的理论基础，强调了计算复杂性视角的重要性。

Abstract: Ensemble models are widely recognized in the ML community for their limited
interpretability. For instance, while a single decision tree is considered
interpretable, ensembles of trees (e.g., boosted trees) are often treated as
black-boxes. Despite this folklore recognition, there remains a lack of
rigorous mathematical understanding of what particularly makes an ensemble
(un)-interpretable, including how fundamental factors like the (1) *number*,
(2) *size*, and (3) *type* of base models influence its interpretability. In
this work, we seek to bridge this gap by applying concepts from computational
complexity theory to study the challenges of generating explanations for
various ensemble configurations. Our analysis uncovers nuanced complexity
patterns influenced by various factors. For example, we demonstrate that under
standard complexity assumptions like P$\neq$NP, interpreting ensembles remains
intractable even when base models are of constant size. Surprisingly, the
complexity changes drastically with the number of base models: small ensembles
of decision trees are efficiently interpretable, whereas interpreting ensembles
with even a constant number of linear models remains intractable. We believe
that our findings provide a more robust foundation for understanding the
interpretability of ensembles, emphasizing the benefits of examining it through
a computational complexity lens.

Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在高分辨率、多尺度PDE建模中因注意力机制的二次计算成本和与离散化的耦合而难以扩展。

Method: Mondrian将域分解为子域，在子域内使用神经算子替代标准层，并通过基于softmax的内积计算子域间的注意力。支持分层窗口和邻域注意力。

Result: 在Allen-Cahn和Navier-Stokes PDE上表现优异，支持分辨率扩展而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: Mondrian展示了域分解注意力在可扩展和通用神经算子中的潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential
equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling
transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains
remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to
discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that
decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over
sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain
decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each
subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and
attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over
functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and
neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian
achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating
resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of
domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder
autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and
planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving
dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance
improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a
strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics.
Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has
important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model
development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number
of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training
compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows,
optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset
size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that
sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive
with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models
becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results
demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties
of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their
performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly
study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to
improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address
the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data
from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in
scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.
However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the
reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for
research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance
frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique
error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical
data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance
benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks
for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing
LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This
multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need
of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of
dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework
supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.
By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,
this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of
AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution
generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of
the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its
generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is
deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random
augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the
stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding
augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic
forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization
effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong
generalization performance across various single source domain generalization
(sDG) benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信号时序逻辑（STL）的框架，用于评估和改进大语言模型（LLM）在数学推理任务中的逐步置信度，从而提高其输出的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学推理任务中表现出色，但容易产生高置信度却错误的输出，这在教育等领域存在风险。

Method: 利用STL定义时序约束，计算鲁棒性分数作为置信度估计，并引入不确定性重塑策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了校准指标，提供了比传统方法更可靠的置信度估计。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了LLMs在数学推理任务中的置信度可靠性和输出质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in
mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which
poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the
expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured
framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it
using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based
constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness
scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our
approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce
smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning
trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves
calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than
conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.

Result: 实验表明，网络倾向于学习正则表示，且在多个数据集上性能与现有方法相当或更好，同时参数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单高效的近似等变解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions,
embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of
tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive,
with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We
propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance
for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the
loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group
representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn
the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields
a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss
penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against
several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves
similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一种结合超网络和区间算术的新方法，旨在同时解决灾难性遗忘和对抗攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络存在灾难性遗忘和对输入数据扰动的脆弱性，目前尚无模型能同时解决这两个问题。

Method: SHIELD通过超网络生成针对特定任务的目标模型权重，并结合区间算术为输入数据提供严格的安全保证。

Result: SHIELD能够在持续学习中动态生成任务专用网络，同时抵御对抗攻击。

Conclusion: SHIELD在提升安全性的同时保持了网络的适应性，解决了持续学习中的安全性挑战。

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including
catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to
quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the
lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice,
we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's
predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and
training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately.
Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic
forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD
(Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel
approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with
interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task
embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific
data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for
each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across
all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined
interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the
given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against
all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach
enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the
overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Method: HC-RLHF训练奖励模型和成本模型，分两步优化：悲观约束下优化奖励，再通过安全测试验证性能。

Result: 实验表明HC-RLHF在Qwen2和LLaMa3模型上显著提升安全性和帮助性。

Conclusion: HC-RLHF能高概率生成安全模型，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a
tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in
sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose
High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a
method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing
helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human
preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by
training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a
two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the
reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost
constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to
verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the
actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including
proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater
than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF
to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and
LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF
produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and
helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Result: 实验表明LIES生成的公式稀疏且准确，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LIES框架通过其设计组件有效提升了符号回归的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical
expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and
analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often
rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with
scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity,
Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable
primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We
develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training
with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to
promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it
applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned
expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that
the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae
outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design
component through ablation studies.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络设计提供了高效且连续的优化途径。

Abstract: Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a
neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes
architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a
fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the
architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a
universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric
information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural
networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly
initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to
obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and
weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness
penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression
tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact
neural networks with strong performance.

Motivation: 解决智能电网中电池动态建模的挑战，包括太阳能的随机性和家庭负载的变异性，传统方法难以捕捉未建模的残差动态。

Method: 提出基于UDE的方法，将神经残差嵌入物理启发的电池ODE中，利用合成数据模拟电池动态。

Result: 训练后的UDE与真实电池轨迹高度吻合，收敛平滑，长期预测稳定。

Conclusion: UDE方法适用于分散式能源网络中的电池建模，对实时控制和优化有广泛意义。

Abstract: Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which blend neural networks with
physical differential equations, have emerged as a powerful framework for
scientific machine learning (SciML), enabling data-efficient, interpretable,
and physically consistent modeling. In the context of smart grid systems,
modeling node-wise battery dynamics remains a challenge due to the
stochasticity of solar input and variability in household load profiles.
Traditional approaches often struggle with generalization and fail to capture
unmodeled residual dynamics. This work proposes a UDE-based approach to learn
node-specific battery evolution by embedding a neural residual into a
physically inspired battery ODE. Synthetic yet realistic solar generation and
load demand data are used to simulate battery dynamics over time. The neural
component learns to model unobserved or stochastic corrections arising from
heterogeneity in node demand and environmental conditions. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that the trained UDE aligns closely with ground truth
battery trajectories, exhibits smooth convergence behavior, and maintains
stability in long-term forecasts. These findings affirm the viability of
UDE-based SciML approaches for battery modeling in decentralized energy
networks and suggest broader implications for real-time control and
optimization in renewable-integrated smart grids.

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了模型特定的特征缩放选择指导，并公开了所有代码和结果以确保透明性和可重复性。

Abstract: This research addresses the critical lack of comprehensive studies on feature
scaling by systematically evaluating 12 scaling techniques - including several
less common transformations - across 14 different Machine Learning algorithms
and 16 datasets for classification and regression tasks. We meticulously
analyzed impacts on predictive performance (using metrics such as accuracy,
MAE, MSE, and $R^2$) and computational costs (training time, inference time,
and memory usage). Key findings reveal that while ensemble methods (such as
Random Forest and gradient boosting models like XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM)
demonstrate robust performance largely independent of scaling, other widely
used models such as Logistic Regression, SVMs, TabNet, and MLPs show
significant performance variations highly dependent on the chosen scaler. This
extensive empirical analysis, with all source code, experimental results, and
model parameters made publicly available to ensure complete transparency and
reproducibility, offers model-specific crucial guidance to practitioners on the
need for an optimal selection of feature scaling techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架虽能增强LLM推理能力，但存在计算成本高和缺乏收敛保证的问题。

Method: 将多LLM协调建模为不完全信息博弈，通过贝叶斯纳什均衡实现分布式推理与集中输出的结合。

Result: ECON在六个复杂推理和规划任务上平均表现优于现有方法11.2%，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: ECON为更强大、可扩展的多LLM集成提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and
lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM
coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic
beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via
Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that
marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each
LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward,
conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly
inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly
tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically,
ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six
benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments
demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models,
confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful
multi-LLM ensembles. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有基准主要评估被动推理，缺乏对主动推理（需与外部系统交互）的系统性研究。

Method: 设计了AR-Bench，包含三类任务（侦探案例、情境谜题、猜数字），模拟现实场景并测试常识、逻辑和符号推理能力。

Result: 当代LLM在主动推理上表现较差，难以获取或利用所需信息，且现有策略改进有限。

Conclusion: 需发展新方法（如交互学习、实时反馈）以提升主动推理能力，AR-Bench已公开。

Abstract: While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive
reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a
solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with
external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little
systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel
benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.
AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and
guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and
measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning
challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary
LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently
fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap
highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning
abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,
such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest
gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.
Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology
for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time
feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training. The benchmark is
publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/AR-Bench.

Conclusion: H$^2$GFM为图基础模型提供了更广泛的适用性，特别是在处理异质文本属性图方面表现出色。

Abstract: The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains
have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across
different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing
research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the
heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on
homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple
types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and
applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to
generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse
meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a
context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To
achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph
transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context
neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT
experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types.
Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as
learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Conclusion: L-STEP提供了一种高效且灵活的位置编码方法，适用于动态图数据，并在多个任务中展现了显著优势。

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning
frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a
positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent
state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However,
the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most
positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are
inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering
works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the
structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving
topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are
equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their
capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on
large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable
Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and
propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for
L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the
graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that
MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance
on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to
show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less
empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link
prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in
both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation
that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the
practical relevance of our theoretical findings in simulations.

Result: SCUD模型在多种数据上表现优于掩码扩散模型。

Conclusion: 通过利用离散马尔可夫过程的跳跃特性，SCUD模型显著提升了离散扩散模型的性能。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate
high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a
Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual
benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising
Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice,
however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is,
surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we
explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes
use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov
processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed
rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in
the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show
that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any
discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete
diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking
diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate
inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that
outperform masking.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive
representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world
scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models,
the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on
unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges
as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the
pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a
systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we
introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the
foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in
graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph
prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph
prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges
in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Conclusion: 本文通过简化分析和离散噪声替代，在扩散生成模型中实现了理论严谨性与实际效率的统一。

Abstract: Diffusion models, formulated as discretizations of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs), achieve state-of-the-art generative performance. However,
existing analyses of their discretization error often rely on complex
probabilistic tools. In this work, we present a simplified theoretical
framework for analyzing the Euler--Maruyama discretization of
variance-preserving SDEs (VP-SDEs) in Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
(DDPMs), where $ T $ denotes the number of denoising steps in the diffusion
process. Our approach leverages Gr\"onwall's inequality to derive a convergence
rate of $ \mathcal{O}(1/T^{1/2}) $ under Lipschitz assumptions, significantly
streamlining prior proofs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gaussian noise
in the discretization can be replaced by a discrete random variable (e.g.,
Rademacher or uniform noise) without sacrificing convergence guarantees-an
insight with practical implications for efficient sampling. Experiments
validate our theory, showing that (1) the error scales as predicted, (2)
discrete noise achieves comparable sample quality to Gaussian noise, and (3)
incorrect noise scaling degrades performance. By unifying simplified analysis
and discrete noise substitution, our work bridges theoretical rigor with
practical efficiency in diffusion-based generative modeling.

*Emo Todorov*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化框架，将控制权转移给参数化策略，从而在自治系统层面简化算法，并证明其与传统强化学习方法等效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习和动态规划方法复杂，希望通过自治系统的视角简化优化过程。

Method: 在自治系统层面设计算法，直接优化策略参数，避免使用控制和动作的显式参考。

Result: 新算法与传统方法（如策略梯度、自然梯度等）计算结果一致，并适用于多种任务（如行为克隆、系统辨识等）。

Conclusion: 该框架为生成式AI模型调优等任务提供了更简洁的优化视角。

Abstract: We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a
(parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the
policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to
optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions,
and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and
Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous
system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy
gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to
approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since
policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same
algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system
identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is
not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to
Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion: 该框架为关系学习提供了严格的实体级差分隐私保证，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning with relational and network-structured data is increasingly vital in
sensitive domains where protecting the privacy of individual entities is
paramount. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled approach for
quantifying privacy risks, with DP-SGD emerging as a standard mechanism for
private model training. However, directly applying DP-SGD to relational
learning is challenging due to two key factors: (i) entities often participate
in multiple relations, resulting in high and difficult-to-control sensitivity;
and (ii) relational learning typically involves multi-stage, potentially
coupled (interdependent) sampling procedures that make standard privacy
amplification analyses inapplicable. This work presents a principled framework
for relational learning with formal entity-level DP guarantees. We provide a
rigorous sensitivity analysis and introduce an adaptive gradient clipping
scheme that modulates clipping thresholds based on entity occurrence frequency.
We also extend the privacy amplification results to a tractable subclass of
coupled sampling, where the dependence arises only through sample sizes. These
contributions lead to a tailored DP-SGD variant for relational data with
provable privacy guarantees. Experiments on fine-tuning text encoders over
text-attributed network-structured relational data demonstrate the strong
utility-privacy trade-offs of our approach. Our code is available at

Abstract: We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning

neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training
process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary
approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental
results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image
classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing
it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges
the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization

Motivation: 自适应梯度方法计算高效但泛化能力差，二阶方法泛化能力强但计算和内存成本高，因此需要一种平衡两者的方法。

Method: 使用特征值偏移的Nystrom方法近似激活协方差矩阵作为预处理矩阵。

Result: NysAct在测试精度上优于一阶和二阶方法，同时计算资源需求显著低于二阶方法。

Conclusion: NysAct是一种高效且泛化能力强的优化方法，适用于大规模任务。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods are computationally efficient and converge quickly,
but they often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, second-order
methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high
computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable
first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between
state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct
leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation
covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly
reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our
experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared
to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less
computational resources than existing second-order methods. Code is available

Motivation: AFDB的结构存在系统性几何偏差，与实验数据（PDB）的构象多样性不符，影响模型在精细原子几何任务中的表现。

Method: 提出DeSAE（去偏结构自编码器），通过从故意损坏的主链几何中重建自然构象，学习更稳健的结构流形。

Result: DeSAE处理后的AFDB结构显著提升了逆向折叠任务在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预测结构中细微偏差的关键影响，并提出去偏框架，为结构学习任务（如逆向折叠）带来显著改进。

Abstract: The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) offers unparalleled
structural coverage at near-experimental accuracy, positioning it as a valuable
resource for data-driven protein design. However, its direct use in training
deep models that are sensitive to fine-grained atomic geometry, such as inverse
folding, exposes a critical limitation. Comparative analysis of structural
feature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical
regularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the
conformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,
PDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential
for generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we
introduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct
native-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By
training the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly
captures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying
DeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly
improve inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks. This work
highlights the critical impact of subtle systematic biases in predicted
structures and presents a principled framework for debiasing, significantly
boosting the performance of structure-based learning tasks like inverse
folding.

Motivation: 现有方法在反馈空间和协调训练方面存在不足，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将多轮修正建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出DPSDP算法，通过直接偏好学习训练actor-critic系统。

Result: 在MATH 500基准上，五轮修正将准确率从58.2%提升至63.2%。

Conclusion: DPSDP有效提升LLM的推理能力，多智能体协作和泛化能力得到验证。

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to
boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various
methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic
solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches
often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training
of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we
model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and
introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine
answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically,
DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution.
Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show
improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on
benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases
first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An
ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and
out-of-distribution generalization.

findings demonstrate that the combination of appropriate imbalance treatment
techniques with ensemble methods, particularly gcForest, achieves better

significantly to the development of more intelligent and efficient automated
threat detection systems for IoT environments, helping to secure critical
infrastructure against sophisticated cyber attacks while optimizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法依赖于模型初始化的探索能力，而RLTs专注于生成适合学生模型学习的详细解释，提升蒸馏效率。

Result: 实验表明，7B参数的RLT在竞赛和研究生级任务上的表现优于现有蒸馏方法，且能适应更大规模学生模型和分布外任务。

Conclusion: RLTs为强化学习推理框架提供了更高的效率和可重用性。

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for
one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve
its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of
reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and
cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From
these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration
challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs)
focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are
prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to
simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their
students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation
to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In
practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on
competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and
cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of
orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness
when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution
tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning
framework.

Result: 数据增强显著提升了快速增强检测的准确性，空间坐标作为输入特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为时空数据中极端事件的合成数据生成研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind
intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid
intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its
occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the
dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone
undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for
conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning,
ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid
intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that
conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating
spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid
intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to
generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to
address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a
deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation
framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events
during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results
for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a
critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for
research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme
events.

Result: 在分类扩展任务中，FUSE相比现有基线实现了高达23%的显著改进。

Conclusion: FUSE是首次尝试理解并高效计算模糊集嵌入的工作，为集合表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Taxonomy Expansion, which models complex concepts and their relations, can be
formulated as a set representation learning task. The generalization of set,
fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a
semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works
usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not
closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient
formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as
a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE),
satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy
set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on
minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on
the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up
to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to
understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent
diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance
diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on
signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from
the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by
combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation
methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose
Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that
synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of
healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA
creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally
intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both
supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior
diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The
findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to
the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决大规模语言模型在数据耗尽时无法持续扩展的问题，探索数据重用的潜力。

Method: 采用多轮随机梯度下降（multi-pass SGD）训练M维线性模型，假设数据协方差和真实参数具有特定的幂律谱。

Result: 多轮SGD实现了比单轮SGD更低的测试误差，验证了数据重用在数据受限场景下的优势。

Conclusion: 数据重用可以改进现有的缩放定律，尤其是在数据受限的情况下，多轮SGD比单轮SGD更有效。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models
trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase.
However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In
this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear
regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional
linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass
SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has
a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior
with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show
that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$,
where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting,
one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see
e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse
(i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are
also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，分布偏移导致Q值对分布外（OOD）动作的高估问题，现有方法过于保守，限制了Q函数泛化。

Method: 提出平滑贝尔曼算子（SBO），在CHN内通过平滑OOD Q值与邻近样本Q值更新Q值，提升泛化能力。

Result: SQOG在D4RL基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了接近准确的Q值估计。

Conclusion: SQOG通过SBO有效缓解了Q函数泛化的过约束问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts,
leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.
Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they
often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains
the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor
$Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing
$Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its
Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we
propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by
smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show
that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within
the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG),
empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate
$Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GALA为学习率调整提供了高效且自适应的解决方案，显著减少了超参数调优的需求。

Abstract: The performance of an optimizer on large-scale deep learning models depends
critically on fine-tuning the learning rate, often requiring an extensive grid
search over base learning rates, schedules, and other hyperparameters. In this
paper, we propose a principled framework called GALA (Gradient Alignment-based
Learning rate Adaptation), which dynamically adjusts the learning rate by
tracking the alignment between consecutive gradients and using a local
curvature estimate. Guided by the convergence analysis, we formulate the
problem of selecting the learning rate as a one-dimensional online learning
problem. When paired with an online learning algorithm such as
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader, our method produces a flexible, adaptive
learning rate schedule that tends to increase when consecutive gradients are
aligned and decrease otherwise. We establish a data-adaptive convergence rate
for normalized SGD equipped with GALA in the smooth, nonconvex setting.
Empirically, common optimizers such as SGD and Adam, when augmented with GALA,
demonstrate robust performance across a wide range of initial learning rates
and perform competitively without the need for tuning.

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to
democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model
partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the
straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To
address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch
sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource
heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies
the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the
convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework
capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing
latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive
experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and
demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

at the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,
several studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage
attacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to
reconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,
contends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the
effectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as
small batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.
  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that
clients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL
environments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance
failures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To
alleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,
which introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient
regularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world
FL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a
thorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices. Under this
protocol, FedLeak can still achieve high-fidelity data reconstruction, thereby
underscoring the significant vulnerability in FL systems and the urgent need
for more effective defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究委托人与具有私有类型和奖励的战略代理人在重复交互中的学习问题，旨在设计一种鲁棒的在线学习算法以最小化战略后悔。

Method: 采用延迟机制激励近似近视代理行为，结合奖励角度估计框架（包括扇区测试和匹配程序）恢复类型依赖的奖励函数，并使用悲观-乐观LinUCB算法高效探索。

Result: 提出了首个可证明样本高效的算法，实现了接近最优的$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$后悔界。

Conclusion: 该研究为涉及私有类型和战略代理的博弈论场景设计鲁棒在线学习算法开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We study an online learning version of the generalized principal-agent model,
where a principal interacts repeatedly with a strategic agent possessing
private types, private rewards, and taking unobservable actions. The agent is
non-myopic, optimizing a discounted sum of future rewards and may strategically
misreport types to manipulate the principal's learning. The principal,
observing only her own realized rewards and the agent's reported types, aims to
learn an optimal coordination mechanism that minimizes strategic regret. We
develop the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for this challenging
setting. Our approach features a novel pipeline that combines (i) a delaying
mechanism to incentivize approximately myopic agent behavior, (ii) an
innovative reward angle estimation framework that uses sector tests and a
matching procedure to recover type-dependent reward functions, and (iii) a
pessimistic-optimistic LinUCB algorithm that enables the principal to explore
efficiently while respecting the agent's incentive constraints. We establish a
near optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ regret bound for learning the principal's
optimal policy, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. Our
results open up new avenues for designing robust online learning algorithms for
a wide range of game-theoretic settings involving private types and strategic
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在固定时间步长下采样，无法适应不同动态频率的任务需求，限制了性能和效率。

Method: TAWM通过条件化时间步长Δt，并在多样化的Δt值上训练，学习任务的多频动态。

Result: 实验表明，TAWM在多种控制任务中优于传统模型，尤其在观察率变化时表现更优。

Conclusion: TAWM的时间感知设计显著提升了模型性能和数据效率，适用于动态多样的任务。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based
approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the
time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t
values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high-
and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in
the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a
system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both
performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM
consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates
in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and
iterations. Our code can be found online at:

TL;DR: MOBODY是一种基于模型的离线强化学习算法，通过生成目标域的合成转移数据来解决源域和目标域动态不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于目标域的有限数据，无法探索目标域。MOBODY旨在通过学习动态模型生成新数据，扩展目标域的探索能力。

Method: MOBODY利用表示学习发现跨域的共享潜在状态和转移表示，并通过模型生成目标域数据。结合Q加权行为克隆损失稳定训练。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准测试中，MOBODY显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MOBODY通过动态模型和数据增强有效解决了跨域动态不匹配问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the
goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and
target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL
methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the
target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by
the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the
learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets.
We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that
addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via
learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target
domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during
offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn
dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched
dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these
datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY
learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states
and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize
training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the
policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that
regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather
than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned
from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented
source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate
MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: Reinforced RCSL通过引入in-distribution optimal return-to-go机制，解决了RCSL缺乏stitching属性的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCSL因其简单性和稳定性在决策任务中受到关注，但其性能受限于离线数据集的质量，缺乏stitching属性。

Method: 提出Reinforced RCSL框架，引入in-distribution optimal return-to-go机制，避免复杂的回报增强技术。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，Reinforced RCSL在多个基准测试中显著优于标准RCSL。

Conclusion: Reinforced RCSL是一种简单且有效的方法，解决了RCSL的关键限制，提升了决策任务的性能。

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and
stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a
supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This
approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference
(TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the
stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the
quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this
limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced
RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we
call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our
policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the
current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently
outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our
claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KFAC等二阶优化方法虽然收敛快，但计算负担高。本文旨在通过分析Fisher信息矩阵的Kronecker因子，提出高效近似方法以解决这一问题。

Method: 基于对激活和预激活梯度Kronecker因子特征谱的观察，提出高效近似方法，开发出MAC算法，并首次将其应用于Transformer的注意力层。

Result: 实验表明，MAC在准确性、训练时间和内存使用上均优于KFAC及其他先进方法，且在某些条件下能收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: MAC是一种高效且通用的二阶优化方法，特别适合Transformer等复杂架构，代码已开源。

Abstract: Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC,
exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss
landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In
this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher
information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to
activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on
their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in
a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our
knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to
the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate
attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence
property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under
which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various
network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end
training time, and memory usage. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在微调过程中容易受到安全风险的影响，少量恶意或无害数据可能破坏安全保护措施。

Method: 基于对齐方向的概念，提出AsFT方法，将正则化项引入训练目标，以对齐方向为锚点抑制有害方向的更新。

Result: 实验表明，AsFT优于Safe LoRA，减少有害行为7.60%，提升模型性能3.44%，并在多种实验设置中保持稳健表现。

Conclusion: AsFT通过约束微调在安全区域内，有效解决了LLM微调中的安全问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during
fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise
safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction --
defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we
observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In
contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are
strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety
and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this
insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring
Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the
training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to
suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is
constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by
7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining
robust performance across various experimental settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: tLaSDI框架不仅高效且准确，还能揭示系统的潜在热力学行为，为物理空间动力学提供新见解。

Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics
identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric
nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for
dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC
formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning
of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles
such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter
space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning
strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator
to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling
at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers'
equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and
significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost.
Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic
behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space
dynamics.

Motivation: 尽管后验解释技术在神经网络中取得进展，但许多方法依赖启发式且缺乏形式化保证。本研究旨在提供可扩展的形式化保证解释。

Method: 通过构建一个显著简化的网络来抽象原始大型神经网络，逐步细化网络规模直至收敛，以高效验证解释的充分性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了获取可证明充分解释的效率，并提供了网络预测的多层次细粒度解释。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证解释形式化验证的同时，提升了计算效率，为神经网络预测提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for
neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide
formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has
shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by
identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that
predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques.
Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant
scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel
abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient
explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original
large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a
sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for
the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process.
If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively
refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining
provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while
additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's
predictions across different abstraction levels.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SHAMs和DiffGradCAM，分别用于测试和改进CAM方法的鲁棒性，解决了传统CAM在对抗条件下易受被动欺骗的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法仅关注单个logits，而softmax输出的概率估计依赖于logits之间的差异，这导致CAM易受被动欺骗攻击。

Method: 提出SHAMs作为对抗条件下的基准测试方法，并设计DiffGradCAM，一种轻量级且对比性的CAM方法，以抵御被动欺骗。

Result: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM在多类任务中验证了其有效性，DiffGradCAM在非对抗情况下与传统CAM方法表现一致。

Conclusion: SHAMs和DiffGradCAM为基于显著性的解释方法提供了新的鲁棒性测试和改进框架。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g.,
GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual
logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership
probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between
logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs
vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model
is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance.
We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an
\emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM
robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling
vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and
contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to
passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as
GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a
new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based
explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few
and many classes.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is
reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate

persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency
hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address
these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the

over two-dimensional airfoils. The competition attracted over 240 teams, who
were provided with a curated dataset generated via OpenFOAM and evaluated
through a multi-criteria framework encompassing predictive accuracy, physical

This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting
several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation

solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to
outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these
results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the
robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future

Result: 发现特定学习率范围内，GD表现出探索-利用平衡，且训练时间最短，表明混沌动态对训练有积极作用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在混沌起始点附近设置学习率可以加速神经网络训练，为优化算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted
with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational
dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the
neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning
rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD
optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime
of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of
learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions --
as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --.
Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable
accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate
region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial
neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially
illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range
of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters,
and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in
the training of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future
wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose
models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning
capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data
required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication
system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first

propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated
for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus

Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge;
second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based
on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated
reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly
outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release

Motivation: 探讨LLM在推理时生成的激活是否能可靠区分答案的正确性，并验证其任务间的通用性。

Method: 通过训练线性分类器分析不同任务间的激活模式，并使用稀疏正则化等方法验证其局限性。

Result: 线性分类器在不同任务间相似性低，稀疏正则化后支持集几乎不重叠，复杂方法也无法解决。

Conclusion: LLM激活的“真理几何”具有任务依赖性，难以跨任务通用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is
still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed
examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess
whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry
of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that
generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes
with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these
approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically
task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that
linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and,
when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint
supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of
probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation
vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when
examined across tasks.

annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation
framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 22'0000
hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain
(OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders,
and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA
architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single-
and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble
combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting.
SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with
macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in
94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including
cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data
as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked
to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness,
no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical
markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H,
DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on
DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus
than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA
cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and
inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with
ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBFM的新生成框架，显式嵌入物理约束到流匹配目标中，显著提高了物理残差的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法（如扩散模型和流匹配）通常从数据中隐式学习物理规律，缺乏显式物理约束的嵌入。

Method: 结合流匹配损失和基于物理的残差损失，引入时间展开训练，并分析最小噪声水平的作用。

Result: 在三个典型PDE问题上，PBFM的物理残差比FM准确8倍，且在分布准确性上优于现有算法。

Conclusion: PBFM为物理和工程应用中的代理建模、不确定性量化和加速模拟提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

<details>

Motivation: 在上下文学习范式中，示例选择对构建高效提示至关重要，但现有方法在评估大量示例时效率低下。

Method: 将示例选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，提出CASE策略，通过维护‘挑战者’臂短列表减少样本复杂度。

Result: CASE实现了7倍运行时加速和87%的LLM调用减少，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: CASE是一种高效且性能优越的示例选择方法，适用于上下文学习任务。

Abstract: The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot
examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing
effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we
formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification
problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of
arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE
(Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient
selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms,
which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of
the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby
reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations.
Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a
parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits
setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in
runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing
performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods. We release
our code and data at https://github.com/kiranpurohit/CASE

Motivation: 现有图基准假设边是非空间且简单的，忽略了物理上不同的路径。HSG-12M填补了这一空白，保留了多条几何路径。

Method: 通过Poly2Graph管道将一维晶体的哈密顿量映射为谱图，生成11.6M静态和5.1M动态图。

Conclusion: HSG-12M为几何感知图学习和数据驱动的科学发现奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing
physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first
large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a
metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two
nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and
5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401
characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential
data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum
on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that
transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,
we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that
maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with
popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at
scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as
universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,
forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for
geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific
discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Conclusion: TiViT展示了视觉表示在非视觉领域的复用潜力，为时间序列分类提供了新方向。

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry,
yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by
the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we
propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series
into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision
Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we
theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for
time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens
and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification
benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We
explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate
layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series
classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM
representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further
performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet
another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

Motivation: 解决DICE框架在离线约束强化学习中因半梯度优化导致的成本估计失败问题，提升其离线策略评估和约束RL性能。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过半梯度DICE优化，确保准确成本估计，并在离线约束RL基准DSRL上实现最优性能。

Result: 新方法在DSRL基准上实现了最先进的性能，解决了成本估计失败问题。

Conclusion: 通过半梯度DICE优化，本文方法成功解决了离线约束RL中的成本估计问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch
between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target
distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy
optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the
flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating
costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches
designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework
inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for
constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this
limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a
fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost
estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE
and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost
estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained
RL benchmark, DSRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨模态嵌入（如CLIP、BLIP）在跨模态对齐上表现良好，但在单模态任务上性能不及单模态嵌入；而单模态嵌入缺乏跨模态对齐能力。因此，需要一种方法统一两者。

Method: RP-KrossFuse利用随机投影的Kronecker乘积融合跨模态和单模态嵌入，通过样本对相似性分数在核空间中高效操作，并支持可扩展实现。

Result: 实验表明，RP-KrossFuse在结合CLIP嵌入与单模态嵌入时，既能保持跨模态对齐，又在单模态任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: RP-KrossFuse成功弥合了跨模态和单模态嵌入之间的性能差距，实现了两者的统一。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved
promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these
embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality
embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality
embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities.
In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and
single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert
embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment.
To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random
projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with
single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise
similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a
specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier
features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical
experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text
embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves
competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal
alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

Conclusion: JoFormer为Transformer中位置结构的整合提供了理论支持，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

Result: 发现数据集中超过50%的样本是冗余的，导致模型性能被高估，且标准机器学习实践可能不适用于流量分类。

Conclusion: 提出新的任务定义和评估方向，以解决数据冗余问题并重新调整领域研究。

Abstract: Machine learning has been applied to network traffic classification (TC) for
over two decades. While early efforts used shallow models, the latter 2010s saw
a shift toward complex neural networks, often reporting near-perfect accuracy.
However, it was recently revealed that a simple k-NN baseline using packet
sequences metadata (sizes, times, and directions) can be on par or even
outperform more complex methods. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon
further and evaluate this baseline across 12 datasets and 15 TC tasks, and
investigate why it performs so well. Our analysis shows that most datasets
contain over 50% redundant samples (identical packet sequences), which
frequently appear in both training and test sets due to common splitting
practices. This redundancy can lead to overestimated model performance and
reduce the theoretical maximum accuracy when identical flows have conflicting
labels. Given its distinct characteristics, we further argue that standard
machine learning practices adapted from domains like NLP or computer vision may
be ill-suited for TC. Finally, we propose new directions for task formulation
and evaluation to address these challenges and help realign the field.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据通常是多变量的，存在复杂的通道间依赖关系、异步采样和缺失值问题，而现有模型通常基于过于简化的假设，无法应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出ChannelTokenFormer，通过灵活的架构显式捕捉跨通道交互、适应通道异步采样并有效处理缺失值。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上的实验表明，ChannelTokenFormer在复杂现实条件下具有优越的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: ChannelTokenFormer为解决多变量时间序列预测中的实际问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting
complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its
own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and
operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges
related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of
which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical
settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified
assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully
observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios.
To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based
forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture
cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and
effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world
industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练过程中难以正确建模量化噪声，导致网络性能不佳。

Method: 在传统端到端训练后，对网络的部分进行基于量化潜在表示的重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在均匀标量量化和熵约束量化中均能带来额外的编码增益，且不增加推理复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过正确量化数据的重新训练，可以显著提升图像压缩网络的性能。

Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational
autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional
approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the
quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since
it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a
differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there
are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model
the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks.
Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional
end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents
obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like
Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly
difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents
are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy
model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized
data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and
especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference
complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and
2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta
bitrate.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to
large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their

address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM
reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide

search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our
framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including
math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves
the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring

Conclusion: 该研究为共识聚类中的公平性问题提供了理论基础和实用算法，可能对其他聚类问题的公平性研究产生广泛影响。

Abstract: Consensus clustering, a fundamental task in machine learning and data
analysis, aims to aggregate multiple input clusterings of a dataset,
potentially based on different non-sensitive attributes, into a single
clustering that best represents the collective structure of the data. In this
work, we study this fundamental problem through the lens of fair clustering, as
introduced by Chierichetti et al. [NeurIPS'17], which incorporates the
disparate impact doctrine to ensure proportional representation of each
protected group in the dataset within every cluster. Our objective is to find a
consensus clustering that is not only representative but also fair with respect
to specific protected attributes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address this problem and provide a constant-factor approximation.
  As part of our investigation, we examine how to minimally modify an existing
clustering to enforce fairness -- an essential postprocessing step in many
clustering applications that require fair representation. We develop an optimal
algorithm for datasets with equal group representation and near-linear time
constant factor approximation algorithms for more general scenarios with
different proportions of two group sizes. We complement our approximation
result by showing that the problem is NP-hard for two unequal-sized groups.
Given the fundamental nature of this problem, we believe our results on Closest
Fair Clustering could have broader implications for other clustering problems,
particularly those for which no prior approximation guarantees exist for their
fair variants.

Conclusion: IS-DAAs是一种有效的方法，能够显著改善DAAs的过优化问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in
which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded
performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel
importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of
offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective
with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution.
IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance
sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate
over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve
better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our
implementations are provided publicly at this link.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于变分自编码器（VAE）的VAE-LF模型，用于高效表示和补全高维不完整电力负荷监测数据，实验表明其在稀疏数据下表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中高维不完整电力负荷监测数据对负荷预测模型性能提出挑战，需高效数据补全方法。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器结构的VAE-LF模型，将数据分向量输入并生成补全数据。

Result: 在UK-DALE数据集上，VAE-LF在5%和10%稀疏度下RMSE和MAE显著优于基准模型，尤其适用于低稀疏度数据。

Conclusion: VAE-LF为智能电网电力负荷管理提供了高效的数据补全解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI)
Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load
Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential
characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a
low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder
structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them
sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data.
Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark
models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE
and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method
provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in
smart grids.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM基准的框架R-ICE，用于估算提示级推理碳排放，解决了现有工具的高数据需求、侵入性和误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和LLMs的广泛应用对能源和环境造成负担，但目前缺乏有效的碳排放估算工具，阻碍可持续发展目标的实现。

Method: 利用现有SOTA基准和相关数据点，开发非侵入性的框架R-ICE，估算提示级推理碳排放。

Result: 验证结果表明，基于基准的建模在碳排放估算方面具有潜力，支持动态LLM路由和碳核算等应用。

Conclusion: R-ICE框架为碳排放估算提供了实用且非侵入性的解决方案，值得科学界进一步探索。

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies
ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)
puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a
hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in
any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption
of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy
consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the
consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and
estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error
margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data
points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of
the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current
approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt
level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA)
benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to
enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our
promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great
potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration
from the scientific community.

TL;DR: RRP是一种新的强化学习探索策略，通过向环境奖励添加零均值噪声增强策略多样性，提升探索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有探索策略（如动作扰动）可能不足以充分探索环境，RRP通过奖励扰动提供补充。

Method: 在环境奖励中添加零均值噪声，与动作扰动策略兼容，易于集成到现有RL算法中。

Result: 实验表明RRP显著提升了PPO和SAC的性能，提高了样本效率并避免局部最优。

Conclusion: RRP通过奖励扰动与噪声驱动探索的理论联系，展示了其在强化学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy
for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that
adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy
diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is
fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies,
such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization,
providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general,
lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal
implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a
theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration,
highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP
significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft
Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima
across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多视图、多输出的GNN模型，结合政府检查评分和众包报告数据预测城市事件的真实状态，并在纽约市案例中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市时空预测中，政府检查评分稀疏且众包报告存在偏差，需要一种方法结合两者预测事件的真实状态。

Method: 提出多视图、多输出的GNN模型，整合政府评分和众包报告数据。

Result: 模型在真实和半合成数据上优于仅使用单一数据源的模型，并量化了众包报告的群体偏差。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用异构、稀疏和偏差数据进行潜在状态预测提供了广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal
forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting,
government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like
potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street
conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection
ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of
neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via
crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to
heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a
multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and
biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we
investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect,
standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced
reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139
types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that
our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only
reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data
is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic
biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report
problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach
for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在深度增加时容易出现梯度爆炸或消失问题，现有研究多局限于全连接网络和独立同分布权重，无法适应现代网络的结构化和相关性需求。

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论的最新进展，建立了一个适用于稀疏性和弱相关权重的稳定性定理。

Result: 为更广泛的网络模型提供了谱稳定性的严格保证，扩展了初始化方案的理论适用范围。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有结构化和依赖性随机性的现代神经网络提供了更坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing
gradients as depth increases, a phenomenon closely tied to the spectral
behavior of the input-output Jacobian. Prior work has identified critical
initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are
typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this
work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general
stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as
that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g.
induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix
theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much
broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for
initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent
randomness.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly

prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural

access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of
principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to
prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their
trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world
applicability through a series of case studies.

Conclusion: IMAGIC-500数据集和基准测试有助于开发鲁棒的填补算法，推动社会科学研究的可复现性。

Abstract: Missing data imputation in tabular datasets remains a pivotal challenge in
data science and machine learning, particularly within socioeconomic research.
However, real-world socioeconomic datasets are typically subject to strict data
protection protocols, which often prohibit public sharing, even for synthetic
derivatives. This severely limits the reproducibility and accessibility of
benchmark studies in such settings. Further, there are very few publicly
available synthetic datasets. Thus, there is limited availability of benchmarks
for systematic evaluation of imputation methods on socioeconomic datasets,
whether real or synthetic. In this study, we utilize the World Bank's publicly
available synthetic dataset, Synthetic Data for an Imaginary Country, which
closely mimics a real World Bank household survey while being fully public,
enabling broad access for methodological research. With this as a starting
point, we derived the IMAGIC-500 dataset: we select a subset of 500k
individuals across approximately 100k households with 19 socioeconomic
features, designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of real-world
household surveys. This paper introduces a comprehensive missing data
imputation benchmark on IMAGIC-500 under various missing mechanisms (MCAR, MAR,
MNAR) and missingness ratios (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%). Our evaluation
considers the imputation accuracy for continuous and categorical variables,
computational efficiency, and impact on downstream predictive tasks, such as
estimating educational attainment at the individual level. The results
highlight the strengths and weaknesses of statistical, traditional machine
learning, and deep learning imputation techniques, including recent
diffusion-based methods. The IMAGIC-500 dataset and benchmark aim to facilitate
the development of robust imputation algorithms and foster reproducible social
science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算环境中任务调度的复杂性、动态性和多目标性导致传统启发式算法难以生成最优调度方案，而强化学习算法又因学习时间过长而受限。

Method: 提出aRL方法，结合智能探索和动作屏蔽技术，减少无关动作的随机探索，提升RL-agent的预测性和适应性。

Result: 实验表明，aRL在命中率和收敛速度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: aRL是一种适用于边缘计算中软实时应用任务调度的有效方法。

Abstract: Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing
significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing
environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential
growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and
highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the
complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and
metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating
optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to
adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of
edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been
incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions
inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant
limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time
required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale
problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and
frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study
proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs
informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the
predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and
convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the
tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments
demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking
methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the
baseline approaches.

Method: 创建基于结构属性的新图，结合原始图和多视图结构，自适应学习权重。

Result: 在异质性数据集上达到或接近最优性能。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息指导GNN可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with heterophilic data, where
connected nodes may have dissimilar labels, as they typically assume homophily
and rely on local message passing. To address this, we propose creating
alternative graph structures by linking nodes with similar structural
attributes (e.g., role-based or global), thereby fostering higher label
homophily on these new graphs. We theoretically prove that GNN performance can
be improved by utilizing graphs with fewer false positive edges (connections
between nodes of different classes) and that considering multiple graph views
increases the likelihood of finding such beneficial structures. Building on
these insights, we introduce Structure-Guided GNN (SG-GNN), an architecture
that processes the original graph alongside the newly created structural
graphs, adaptively learning to weigh their contributions. Extensive experiments
on various benchmark datasets, particularly those with heterophilic
characteristics, demonstrate that our SG-GNN achieves state-of-the-art or
highly competitive performance, highlighting the efficacy of exploiting
structural information to guide GNNs.

Abstract: Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning
natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic
probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model
two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel
information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that
captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances
representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning
separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence.
Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between
the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce
a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic
representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual
connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on
synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool
for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at

SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning
accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning
research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can
be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute
resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific
tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing
because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL,
including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a
fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions
have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across
time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for
modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic
model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant
future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are
often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include
in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention
increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with
generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method
intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative
methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$
image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8
\times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于代理的建模（ABM）在理解自组织生物系统方面具有强大能力，但其计算密集且难以解析。现有的方程学习（EQL）方法需要大量模拟，通用性受限。

Method: 提出了两种ME-EQL方法：OAT ME-EQL（逐个参数学习并通过插值连接）和ES ME-EQL（构建跨参数的统一模型库）。

Result: 两种方法均显著降低了从ABM模拟中恢复参数的相对误差，其中OAT ME-EQL在参数空间中的通用性更好。

Conclusion: 多实验方程学习能够提升复杂生物系统学习模型的通用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful tool for understanding
self-organizing biological systems, but it is computationally intensive and
often not analytically tractable. Equation learning (EQL) methods can derive
continuum models from ABM data, but they typically require extensive
simulations for each parameter set, raising concerns about generalizability. In
this work, we extend EQL to Multi-experiment equation learning (ME-EQL) by
introducing two methods: one-at-a-time ME-EQL (OAT ME-EQL), which learns
individual models for each parameter set and connects them via interpolation,
and embedded structure ME-EQL (ES ME-EQL), which builds a unified model library
across parameters. We demonstrate these methods using a birth--death mean-field
model and an on-lattice agent-based model of birth, death, and migration with
spatial structure. Our results show that both methods significantly reduce the
relative error in recovering parameters from agent-based simulations, with OAT
ME-EQL offering better generalizability across parameter space. Our findings
highlight the potential of equation learning from multiple experiments to
enhance the generalizability and interpretability of learned models for complex
biological systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LMDI+的新方法，用于解决现有局部特征重要性方法（如LIME和TreeSHAP）在解释树模型预测时的不足。LMDI+通过扩展全局MDI+框架，显著提升了实例特定特征识别的性能，并在多个真实数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 树模型（如随机森林）在高风险领域广泛应用，但其局部特征重要性方法（如LIME和TreeSHAP）依赖近似和扰动，导致解释不稳定。MDI+在全局设定中解决了这一问题，但无法处理个体异质性。因此，需要一种更稳定的局部解释方法。

Method: 作者提出了LMDI+，将MDI+框架扩展到样本特定设定，利用决策树与线性模型在节点基上的等价性，生成更稳定的局部特征重要性。

Result: LMDI+在12个真实数据集上平均提升下游任务性能10%，并表现出更高的稳定性，能生成一致的实例级特征重要性排名。此外，LMDI+还支持局部可解释性用例，如识别更接近的反事实和发现同质子组。

Conclusion: LMDI+是一种高效的局部特征重要性方法，显著优于现有基线，为树模型的解释提供了更稳定和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Tree-based ensembles such as random forests remain the go-to for tabular data
over deep learning models due to their prediction performance and computational
efficiency. These advantages have led to their widespread deployment in
high-stakes domains, where interpretability is essential for ensuring
trustworthy predictions. This has motivated the development of popular local
(i.e. sample-specific) feature importance (LFI) methods such as LIME and
TreeSHAP. However, these approaches rely on approximations that ignore the
model's internal structure and instead depend on potentially unstable
perturbations. These issues are addressed in the global setting by MDI+, a
feature importance method which exploits an equivalence between decision trees
and linear models on a transformed node basis. However, the global MDI+ scores
are not able to explain predictions when faced with heterogeneous individual
characteristics. To address this gap, we propose Local MDI+ (LMDI+), a novel
extension of the MDI+ framework to the sample specific setting. LMDI+
outperforms existing baselines LIME and TreeSHAP in identifying
instance-specific signal features, averaging a 10% improvement in downstream
task performance across twelve real-world benchmark datasets. It further
demonstrates greater stability by consistently producing similar instance-level
feature importance rankings across multiple random forest fits. Finally, LMDI+
enables local interpretability use cases, including the identification of
closer counterfactuals and the discovery of homogeneous subgroups.

TL;DR: BioLangFusion通过整合预训练的DNA、mRNA和蛋白质语言模型，生成统一的分子表示，在分子属性预测任务中表现优于单模态基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受分子生物学中心法则（信息从基因到转录本再到蛋白质的流动）启发，研究如何整合多模态分子数据。

Method: 采用三种标准融合技术：密码子级嵌入拼接、熵正则化注意力池化和跨模态多头注意力，无需额外预训练。

Result: 在五个分子属性预测任务中，BioLangFusion优于单模态基线，表明简单融合预训练模型即可捕获互补的多组学信息。

Conclusion: BioLangFusion展示了通过简单融合预训练模型，可以高效整合多模态分子数据，提升预测性能。

Abstract: We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA,
mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations.
Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene
to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically
meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure
direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion
techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized
attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal
multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for
combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional
pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward
integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five
molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal
baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture
complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KARMA提出了一种自适应时间通道分解模块（ATCD）和混合频率-时间分解模块（HFTD），结合多尺度Mamba-based KarmaBlock，显著提升了多变量长期时间序列预测的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分解方法单一且依赖固定规则，无法挖掘潜在信息或适应复杂动态特性；Transformer模型因计算复杂度高而难以有效建模长序列和复杂动态关系。

Method: KARMA通过ATCD动态提取趋势和季节性成分，HFTD进一步分解序列为频域和时域，结合多尺度KarmaBlock协调处理全局和局部信息。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上的实验表明，KARMA在预测准确性和计算效率上显著优于主流基线方法。

Conclusion: KARMA通过动态分解和高效信息处理，解决了传统方法和Transformer模型的局限性，为多变量长期时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key
requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex
interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition
modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on
fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the
series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the
other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle
to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to
their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to
dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a
Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series
into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with
multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local
information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets
from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms
mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational
efficiency. Code and full results are available at this repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注环境状态扰动，而这是具身场景中的自然现象，因此需要提升DRL代理在此类扰动下的鲁棒性。

Method: 首先提出一种非目标攻击方法作为校准对手，随后设计BAT框架，通过监督学习调整代理以避免灾难性失败，再通过强化学习进行对抗训练。

Result: 实验证明主流代理在环境状态扰动下存在脆弱性，BAT框架能显著提升代理的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BAT框架在多种情况下有效增强了代理对环境状态扰动的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒强化学习算法可能不适用。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider
environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To
improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental
state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a
calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted
Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised
learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains
the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results
substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state
perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results
demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may
not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of
agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了数据效率和模型性能，使小样本训练的奖励模型达到与大规模数据集相当的结果。

Conclusion: 数据高效策略在奖励模型优化中具有潜力，为低资源RLHF应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is
critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion
framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to
achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets.
Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample
pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement,
which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and
high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based
scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level
Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture
finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and
model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to
achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study
underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward
model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF
applications.

Conclusion: 研究为时间序列特性与模型性能的关系提供了新见解，TimeFlex展示了更强的适应性。

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.

Abstract: The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Motivation: 研究如何优化表格基础模型（如TabPFNv2）的微调方法，并理解微调如何改变其内部机制。

Method: 系统评估多种微调策略，分析微调对TabPFNv2内部机制的影响，类比检索增强模型。

Result: 全微调在时间和效果上最优；微调通过改进相似性度量提升性能，在50K规模数据集上表现良好，但在时序数据和复杂特征上不稳定。

Conclusion: 全微调是TabPFNv2的最佳实践，但其适用性受数据集特性影响。

Abstract: Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep
learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over
traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context
learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets.
However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational
models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains
underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational
models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate
fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically
evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings
establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms
of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters
TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models.
We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after
gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of
test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more
accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows
finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately
weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction
logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on
datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost
all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning
allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with
gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and
prior methods remain better.

Result: 在多个主流推理基准测试中，7B和32B模型的平均性能分别提升了10.0%和7.7%。

Conclusion: SwS框架无需外部知识蒸馏，通过自我识别和解决弱点，实现了模型的稳健泛化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as
mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a
high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the
scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification
answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their
effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies
indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's
capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem
Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and
leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as
questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative
sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these
failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas
in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually
overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation,
our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to
self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance
gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法（如流匹配和Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching）只能建模单一路径，无法捕捉从共同起源到多个不同结果的分支或发散演化。

Method: 提出了Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (BranchSBM)，通过参数化多个时间依赖的速度场和增长过程，实现多终端分布的分支建模。

Result: BranchSBM在多路径表面导航、细胞命运分叉建模和细胞响应模拟等任务中表现出更强的表达能力。

Conclusion: BranchSBM为解决多路径生成问题提供了有效工具，扩展了现有方法的适用范围。

Abstract: Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\"odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\"odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

Result: 在多种数据集和训练范式下验证了方法的有效性，适用于动态不确定性和TDDS等剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 分数外推是扩展昂贵分数计算任务（如剪枝、数据归因）的有前景方向。

Abstract: Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning
techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving
model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a
full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any
efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires
training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in
this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately
predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from
this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2
state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training
paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate
that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score
calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency.
Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the

<details>

Motivation: 传统非自回归模型在处理变长序列时表现不佳，通常需要固定的token结构。Edit Flows旨在通过灵活的编辑操作更贴近序列数据的结构。

Method: Edit Flows利用连续时间马尔可夫链在序列空间上建模编辑操作，并通过扩展状态空间和辅助变量实现高效训练。

Result: 实验表明，Edit Flows在图像描述生成任务上优于自回归和掩码模型，在文本和代码生成任务上显著优于掩码构造方法。

Conclusion: Edit Flows通过编辑操作实现了灵活的非自回归生成，显著提升了序列生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为e3的方法，通过训练LLM进行上下文探索，以提升推理能力，并在测试时间预算超出训练范围时实现性能外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型在性能外推方面表现不佳，研究旨在通过上下文探索解决这一问题。

Method: e3方法包括三个关键成分：1) 链式操作（如生成、验证、精炼等）；2) 利用错误轨迹的“负梯度”增强探索；3) 通过特定设计的课程学习结合任务难度与训练预算。

Result: e3-1.7B模型在AIME'25和HMMT'25上表现最佳，并能外推到2倍的训练预算，同时提升了pass@1和pass@k分数。

Conclusion: e3方法通过上下文探索有效提升了LLM的推理能力和外推性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by
utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this
paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard
problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget
they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning
models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is
by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to
effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as
generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses
before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify
three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the
base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with
generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging
"negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL,
resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3)
coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a
specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our
recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25
scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not
only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

TL;DR: FZOO是一种快速零阶优化器，通过减少收敛所需的前向传递次数，显著提升了优化速度，同时保持内存高效性，适用于大型语言模型的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型微调中GPU内存瓶颈问题，同时提升零阶优化器的收敛速度。

Method: 采用批量单边估计和基于损失标准差的步长调整，结合Rademacher随机向量扰动和CUDA并行处理。

Result: FZOO在11个任务中平均比MeZO准确率提升3%，前向传递次数减少3倍；在RoBERTa-large上准确率提升5.6%，前向传递次数减少18倍。

Conclusion: FZOO实现了单GPU高速全参数微调，为内存高效预训练提供了方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks:
the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to
more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order
(ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward
passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to
converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally
improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater
memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast
Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward
passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that
adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also
accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector
perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on
diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3,
across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms
MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For
RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy
and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving
convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis
proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its
convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling
even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed,
full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on
memory-efficient pre-training.

Method: 提出了一种解耦风险可视化方法，分析模型参数和数据参数的风险景观，并引入扩展的Performative Prediction设置。

Result: 通过可视化方法揭示了兴趣点的新特性，并验证了现有算法在更现实条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 可视化方法为Performative Prediction提供了新的实践视角，扩展的设置更贴近现实场景。

Abstract: Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack

*Xiaowen Ma,Chenyang Lin,Yao Zhang,Volker Tresp,Yunpu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Agentic Neural Network（ANN）的框架，将多智能体协作建模为分层神经网络架构，通过动态任务分解和迭代优化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统依赖静态配置，限制了灵活性和适应性。ANN旨在通过神经网络架构实现动态协作。

Method: ANN采用两阶段优化策略：前向阶段动态分解任务并构建协作团队，后向阶段通过反馈优化协作。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，ANN表现优于现有多智能体基线，显著提升了准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: ANN为多智能体系统提供了可扩展、数据驱动的框架，结合了LLMs的协作能力和神经网络的效率。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for
addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely
on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these
constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that
conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network
architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer
forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural
Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing
inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically
decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation
methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring
backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through
iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and
coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or
specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and
adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent
baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance
improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven
framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of
LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan
to open-source the entire framework.

TL;DR: 任务向量通过线性组合原始演示形成，用于加速上下文学习中的推理，但其原理尚不明确。本文提出线性组合猜想，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索任务向量在上下文学习中的形成机制及其功能原理，以提升其应用效果。

Method: 通过损失景观分析验证任务向量在线性变换器中的自然涌现，并预测其在表示高秩映射时的失败。

Result: 任务向量通过线性组合形成，但在高秩映射中表现不佳，通过注入多个任务向量可提升效果。

Conclusion: 任务向量的线性组合猜想得到验证，为理解其在变换器模型中的机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in
in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a
single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain
unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that
task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear
combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical
support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge
in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss
landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on
representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our
findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter
visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple
ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of
task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in
transformer-based models.

TL;DR: 论文研究了代码审查中的偏差现象，提出了分类和检测方法，并证明排除偏差能提升机器学习模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业中的合并请求（MR）流程常偏离标准审查流程，许多MR用于非审查目的，忽略这些偏差会影响分析和机器学习模型的准确性。

Method: 识别了七类偏差，提出了一种少样本学习检测方法（准确率91%），并验证了排除偏差对机器学习模型的改进效果。

Result: 偏差出现在37.02%的MR中，排除后机器学习模型在53.33%的情况下性能提升（最高2.25倍），特征重要性显著变化（整体47%，top-k 60%）。

Conclusion: 研究贡献包括偏差分类、AI检测方法及对机器学习分析影响的实证，帮助优化审查流程和确保可靠分析。

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and
collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate
from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes
(e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations
and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models
for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and
propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding
deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in
53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature
importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven
detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based
review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and
ensuring reliable insights.

Motivation: 揭示t-SNE和UMAP在可视化分析中的常见误用，探究其背后的原因及如何避免。

Method: 通过文献综述（114篇论文）和访谈研究，验证误用现象并分析原因。

Result: 误用主要源于对t-SNE和UMAP在可视化分析中适用性的讨论不足。

Conclusion: 提出未来方向和具体措施，以促进降维技术的合理使用。

Abstract: Misuses of t-SNE and UMAP in visual analytics have become increasingly
common. For example, although t-SNE and UMAP projections often do not
faithfully reflect true distances between clusters, practitioners frequently
use them to investigate inter-cluster relationships. In this paper, we bring
this issue to the surface and comprehensively investigate why such misuse
occurs and how to prevent it. We conduct a literature review of 114 papers to
verify the prevalence of the misuse and analyze the reasonings behind it. We
then execute an interview study to uncover practitioners' implicit motivations
for using these techniques -- rationales often undisclosed in the literature.
Our findings indicate that misuse of t-SNE and UMAP primarily stems from
limited discourse on their appropriate use in visual analytics. We conclude by
proposing future directions and concrete action items to promote more
reasonable use of DR.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的高自由度机器人运动规划方法计算成本高，难以应用于实际场景，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过NMPC生成轨迹，并利用DRL框架学习反应性决策策略，动态选择模型、成本和约束。

Result: 实验证明，Re4MPC比传统NMPC基线方法计算效率更高，且末端执行器目标达成率更高。

Conclusion: Re4MPC为高自由度机器人提供了一种高效的运动规划解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,
such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for
real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion
planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear
Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a
computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and
constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and
robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based
simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate
that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates
in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes
whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非正交矩阵分解方法$D$-decomposition，通过最小化正则化Frobenius损失实现，优于传统方法如SVD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩阵分解方法（如LU或SVD）在控制秩、稀疏性和条件数方面存在局限性，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 采用变分方法定义分解$A \approx P D Q$，通过交替最小化计算，控制秩、稀疏性和条件数。

Result: 实验表明，$D$-decomposition在MovieLens等数据集上重建精度优于截断SVD、CUR和非负矩阵分解。

Conclusion: $D$-decomposition是一种高效且灵活的矩阵分解方法，特别适用于稀疏和噪声数据。

Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of
the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in
\mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The
decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius
loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic
factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization.
We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that
each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated
SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction
accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices,
particularly under sparsity and noise.

TL;DR: 稀疏GeoHOPCA是一种新的稀疏高阶主成分分析方法，通过几何视角优化高维张量分解，提高了计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏高阶主成分分析（SHOPCA）在高维和不平衡数据场景中效率低且难以解释，需要改进。

Method: 将输入张量沿每个模式展开，转化为结构化二元线性优化问题，避免显式协方差估计和迭代放气。

Result: 理论证明几何子问题与原SHOPCA等价，计算复杂度线性增长，实验显示在合成数据、分类和图像重建中表现优异。

Conclusion: 稀疏GeoHOPCA在高效性、可解释性和鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，适用于高维数据。

Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order
principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective
to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along
each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary
linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex
sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for
explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant
gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in
high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the
equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA
formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on
classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The
proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of
$O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with
tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately
recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification
performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image
reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of soft tissue deformation is a critical factor
for surgical robotics and medical training. In this paper, we introduce a novel
physics-informed neural simulator that approximates soft tissue deformations in
a realistic and real-time manner. Our framework integrates Kelvinlet-based
priors into neural simulators, making it the first approach to leverage
Kelvinlets for residual learning and regularization in data-driven soft tissue
modeling. By incorporating large-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations
of both linear and nonlinear soft tissue responses, our method improves neural
network predictions across diverse architectures, enhancing accuracy and
physical consistency while maintaining low latency for real-time performance.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing accurate
surgical maneuvers that simulate the use of standard laparoscopic tissue
grasping tools with high fidelity. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented
learning as a powerful and efficient strategy for real-time, physics-aware soft
tissue simulation in surgical applications.

Abstract: We study Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of
dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse
prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We
introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain
assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning
process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in
real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First,
from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves
interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over
conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from
the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals
improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and
different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into
diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and
provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data
statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can
align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

Motivation: 研究深度强化学习代理在网络安全防御中的表现，并提升其行为的可解释性。

Method: 简化复杂的状态和动作空间，跟踪关键事件，分析环境状态转换和动作效果。

Result: 防御代理通常能在1-2个时间步内清除入侵；某些关键动作的无效性高达40%-99%；诱饵服务能阻止高达94%的特权访问攻击。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了代理行为的有效性，并提出了对CAGE Challenge 4的改进建议。

Abstract: We analyze two open source deep reinforcement learning agents submitted to
the CAGE Challenge 2 cyber defense challenge, where each competitor submitted
an agent to defend a simulated network against each of several provided
rules-based attack agents. We demonstrate that one can gain interpretability of
agent successes and failures by simplifying the complex state and action spaces
and by tracking important events, shedding light on the fine-grained behavior
of both the defense and attack agents in each experimental scenario. By
analyzing important events within an evaluation episode, we identify patterns
in infiltration and clearing events that tell us how well the attacker and
defender played their respective roles; for example, defenders were generally
able to clear infiltrations within one or two timesteps of a host being
exploited. By examining transitions in the environment's state caused by the
various possible actions, we determine which actions tended to be effective and
which did not, showing that certain important actions are between 40% and 99%
ineffective. We examine how decoy services affect exploit success, concluding
for instance that decoys block up to 94% of exploits that would directly grant
privileged access to a host. Finally, we discuss the realism of the challenge
and ways that the CAGE Challenge 4 has addressed some of our concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）代理在训练和微调过程中面临后门攻击的安全风险，可能导致恶意操作。

Method: ReAgent采用两级方法：执行层验证代理思维与行动的一致性；计划层通过代理重建指令的能力检查一致性。

Result: ReAgent在多种任务中有效防御后门攻击，例如在数据库操作任务中将攻击成功率降低高达90%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用被攻击代理自身能力可以缓解后门风险，ReAgent为LLM代理安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model
(LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks
during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be
manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific
triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we
present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on
LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies
among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing
on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential
backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the
agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the
agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought
trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and
the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's
effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance,
ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation
tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the
potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor
risks.

Conclusion: 任务特定指令显著提升MLLMs与大脑活动的对齐性，为研究多模态信息处理提供新途径。

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain
alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus
settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to
generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.
However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily
focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal
models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain
alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity
recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with
audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized
instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned
MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that
instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned
multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for
both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear
disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise
differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find
that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas
showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and
language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide
clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the
alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping
joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly
available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

Conclusion: MOSS通过多目标优化框架有效平衡了稀疏性、准确性和稳定性，为决策规则集的构建提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MOSS, a multi-objective optimization framework for constructing
stable sets of decision rules. MOSS incorporates three important criteria for
interpretability: sparsity, accuracy, and stability, into a single
multi-objective optimization framework. Importantly, MOSS allows a practitioner
to rapidly evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and stability in sparse rule
sets in order to select an appropriate model. We develop a specialized cutting
plane algorithm in our framework to rapidly compute the Pareto frontier between
these two objectives, and our algorithm scales to problem instances beyond the
capabilities of commercial optimization solvers. Our experiments show that MOSS
outperforms state-of-the-art rule ensembles in terms of both predictive
performance and stability.

Abstract: We introduce a continuous policy-value iteration algorithm where the
approximations of the value function of a stochastic control problem and the
optimal control are simultaneously updated through Langevin-type dynamics. This
framework applies to both the entropy-regularized relaxed control problems and
the classical control problems, with infinite horizon. We establish policy
improvement and demonstrate convergence to the optimal control under the
monotonicity condition of the Hamiltonian. By utilizing Langevin-type
stochastic differential equations for continuous updates along the policy
iteration direction, our approach enables the use of distribution sampling and
non-convex learning techniques in machine learning to optimize the value

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Previous algorithms can solve convex-concave minimax problems $\min_{x \in
\mathcal{X}} \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} f(x,y)$ with
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ second-order oracle calls using Newton-type
methods. This result has been speculated to be optimal because the upper bound
is achieved by a natural generalization of the optimal first-order method. In
this work, we show an improved upper bound of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4/7})$ by generalizing the optimal second-order
method for convex optimization to solve the convex-concave minimax problem. We
further apply a similar technique to lazy Hessian algorithms and show that our
proposed algorithm can also be seen as a second-order ``Catalyst'' framework
(Lin et al., JMLR 2018) that could accelerate any globally convergent
algorithms for solving minimax problems.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了利用结构信息加速优化的场景，为实证观察到的性能提升提供了理论解释。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional optimisation problems exhibit rich geometric structures
in their set of minimisers, often forming smooth manifolds due to
over-parametrisation or symmetries. When this structure is known, at least
locally, it can be exploited through reduction mappings that reparametrise part
of the parameter space to lie on the solution manifold. These reductions
naturally arise from inner optimisation problems and effectively remove
redundant directions, yielding a lower-dimensional objective. In this work, we
introduce a general framework to understand how such reductions influence the
optimisation landscape. We show that well-designed reduction mappings improve
curvature properties of the objective, leading to better-conditioned problems
and theoretically faster convergence for gradient-based methods. Our analysis
unifies a range of scenarios where structural information at optimality is
leveraged to accelerate convergence, offering a principled explanation for the
empirical gains observed in such optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: In sparse optimization, enforcing hard constraints using the $\ell_0$
pseudo-norm offers advantages like controlled sparsity compared to convex
relaxations. However, many real-world applications demand not only sparsity
constraints but also some extra constraints. While prior algorithms have been
developed to address this complex scenario with mixed combinatorial and convex
constraints, they typically require the closed form projection onto the mixed
constraints which might not exist, and/or only provide local guarantees of
convergence which is different from the global guarantees commonly sought in
sparse optimization. To fill this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of
sparse optimization with extra \qw{\textit{support-preserving}} constraints
commonly encountered in the literature. We present a new variant of iterative
hard-thresholding algorithm equipped with a two-step consecutive projection
operator customized for these mixed constraints, serving as a simple
alternative to the Euclidean projection onto the mixed constraint. By
introducing a novel trade-off between sparsity relaxation and sub-optimality,
we provide global guarantees in objective value for the output of our
algorithm, in the deterministic, stochastic, and zeroth-order settings, under
the conventional restricted strong-convexity/smoothness assumptions. As a
fundamental contribution in proof techniques, we develop a novel extension of
the classic three-point lemma to the considered two-step non-convex projection
operator, which allows us to analyze the convergence in objective value in an
elegant way that has not been possible with existing techniques. In the
zeroth-order case, such technique also improves upon the state-of-the-art
result from de Vazelhes et. al. (2022), even in the case without additional
constraints, by allowing us to remove a non-vanishing system error present in
their work.

Conclusion: 论文展示了midr包的用法，并讨论了其关键特性。

Abstract: The use of appropriate methods of Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) and
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for adopting black-box
predictive models in fields where model and prediction explainability is
required. As a novel tool for interpreting black-box models, we introduce the R
package midr, which implements Maximum Interpretation Decomposition (MID). MID
is a functional decomposition approach that derives a low-order additive
representation of a black-box model by minimizing the squared error between the
model's prediction function and this additive representation. midr enables
learning from black-box models by constructing a global surrogate model with
advanced analytical capabilities. After reviewing related work and the
theoretical foundation of MID, we demonstrate the package's usage and discuss
some of its key features.

Motivation: 日本金融数据的稀缺性阻碍了金融分析领域的学术创新，尤其是LLM在金融领域的应用和发展。

Method: 通过从日本EDINET系统下载过去10年的年报，自动标注任务标签，构建EDINET-Bench数据集。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的LLM在欺诈检测和盈利预测等任务中表现仅略优于逻辑回归。

Conclusion: LLM在金融领域的实际应用仍面临挑战，需要领域特定的适应，EDINET-Bench的开源将促进未来研究。

Abstract: Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging
financial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic
innovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible
research resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in
this specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an
open-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance
of LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,
earnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by
downloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic
Disclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels
corresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic
regression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings
forecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to
real-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific
adaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is
publicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.

Abstract: This research investigates the use of machine learning methods to forecast

behavioral, academic, and demographic details were used in implementations with
standard classical machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron

all implementations. Under 10-fold cross validation, MLPC obtained 79.58%
average accuracy for test set while for train set, it was 99.65%. MLP's better
performance over other machine learning models strongly suggest the potential
use of neural networks as data-efficient models. Feature selection approach
played a crucial role in improving the performance and multiple evaluation
approaches were used in order to compare with existing literature. Explainable
machine learning methods were utilized to demystify the black box models and to

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁在线安全和包容性，而乌尔都语的仇恨言论检测研究较少，尤其是基于翻译的方法。

Method: 利用注意力层增强Transformer模型（如GPT-3.5 Turbo和Qwen 2.5 72B）的特征提取能力，同时使用TF-IDF支持非Transformer模型。

Result: 在英语、西班牙语和乌尔都语上分别实现了0.87、0.85和0.81的宏F1分数，多语言模型达到0.88。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言仇恨言论检测提供了高效解决方案，有助于构建更安全的数字社区。

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping
opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful
content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity.
While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like
English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using
translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual
dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and
Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced
distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology
leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate
speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature
extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including
GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models
like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators,
following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a
Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5
Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of
0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for
Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B).
These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline
0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM
baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline
0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech
detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

Motivation: 当前LLMs的评估主要集中于英语和高资源语言，缺乏对低资源语言的标准化评估。

Method: 引入mSTEB基准，涵盖语言识别、文本分类、问答和翻译任务，评估了包括Gemini 2.0 Flash、GPT-4o (Audio)等模型。

Result: 评估显示高资源与低资源语言（尤其是非洲和美洲/大洋洲语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更多投资以解决低资源语言在LLMs中的代表性不足问题。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a
wide range of tasks, including in multimodal settings such as speech. However,
their evaluation is often limited to English and a few high-resource languages.
For low-resource languages, there is no standardized evaluation benchmark. In
this paper, we address this gap by introducing mSTEB, a new benchmark to
evaluate the performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks covering language
identification, text classification, question answering, and translation tasks
on both speech and text modalities. We evaluated the performance of leading
LLMs such as Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o (Audio) and state-of-the-art open
models such as Qwen 2 Audio and Gemma 3 27B. Our evaluation shows a wide gap in
performance between high-resource and low-resource languages, especially for
languages spoken in Africa and Americas/Oceania. Our findings show that more
investment is needed to address their under-representation in LLMs coverage.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型成本高昂，且往往偏向主流文化和价值观。领域适应虽能改善模型与多样化文化背景的契合度，但其计算成本仍是一个障碍，尤其是在资源有限的研究环境中。

Method: 通过评估不同数值精度和数据并行化策略对训练速度和模型准确性的影响，研究如何在低资源环境下实现高效的领域适应。

Result: 研究结果为关注能源效率、可访问性或硬件有限的场景提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 调整数值精度和数据并行化策略是降低LLM训练成本的有效方法，有助于在资源受限的环境中实现领域适应。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is costly in terms of energy, hardware,
and annotated data, often resulting in a positionality rooted in predominant
cultures and values (Santy et al., 2023). Domain adaptation has emerged as a
promising strategy to better align models with diverse cultural and value
contexts (Hershcovich et al., 2022), but its computational cost remains a
significant barrier, particularly for research groups lacking access to
large-scale infrastructure. In this paper, we evaluate how the use of different
numerical precisions and data parallelization strategies impacts both training
speed (as a proxy to energy and hardware consumption) and model accuracy, with
the goal of facilitating domain adaptation in low-resource environments. Our
findings are relevant to any setting where energy efficiency, accessibility, or
limited hardware availability are key concerns.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法需要大量计算和数据资源重新训练，成本高昂。

Result: Olica在数据使用、GPU内存和运行时间上高效，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Olica提供了一种高效且无需重新训练的LLM剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs)
require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to
reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To
address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal
decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for
retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer
depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as
unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract
the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or
disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes
unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of
PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally,
to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward
network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct
the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging
singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares
problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage,
GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across
multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date
information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting
information and it remains unclear how models should address such
discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge
conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We
then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of
conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark
that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge
conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that
LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While
prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the
retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of
their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

Abstract: This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may
not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics,
resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such
behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named
CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases
inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests
that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training
sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders
with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best
performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue
of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained
salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in

Result: 在10个表格基准测试中，TableDreamer将Llama3.1-8B-instruct的平均准确率提高了11.62%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TableDreamer通过弱点引导和渐进式合成，显著提升了表格指令调优的效果。

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods,
they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First,
they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding
tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in
table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase
of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored
for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues.
Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as
seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under
the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as
the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments
on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62%
(49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms
state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data. The

solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary
models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token
probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses
optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves
alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by
using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent
token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators,
raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple,
lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment
benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO
consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better
alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种针对核应用领域的特定大型语言模型，基于公开的Essential CANDU教材构建，采用紧凑的Transformer架构，在单GPU上训练以保护核操作中的敏感数据。尽管数据集较小，模型能捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本有时缺乏语法连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种符合严格网络安全和数据保密标准的内部LLM解决方案，专注于核领域内容。

Method: 基于Transformer架构，使用单GPU训练，数据来源于Essential CANDU教材。

Result: 模型能捕捉专业核词汇，但生成文本有时缺乏语法连贯性，初步展示了在专业任务中的实用性。

Conclusion: 未来需扩展数据集、优化预处理和指令微调，以提升领域准确性，并评估模型在核领域实际应用的准备度。

Abstract: This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear
applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook.
Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a
single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations.
Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of
capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes
lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this
approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with
rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in
text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while
also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing,
and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions
include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining
tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's
readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

*Mishca de Costa,Muhammad Anwar,Dave Mercier,Mark Randall,Issam Hammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于函数调用的大型语言模型（LLM）替代传统自然语言转SQL（NL-to-SQL）的方法，以提高核电站数据检索的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL-to-SQL方法在核电站等关键系统中存在验证困难和准确性风险，需要一种更安全可靠的数据检索方式。

Method: 通过预定义一组经过审核的专用函数，封装已验证的SQL逻辑，避免直接生成SQL查询，同时利用NL-to-SQL工具辅助生成函数代码。

Result: 研究表明，基于函数的方法在准确性和可维护性上优于直接NL-to-SQL生成。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种平衡用户易用性与操作安全性的新框架，适用于关键系统的数据检索。

Abstract: Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional
accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports.
Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been
explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses
significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and
legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured --
complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These
challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the
approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging
function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges.
Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved,
purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed
by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid
approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by
ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before
deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and
maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist
in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on
validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison
between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach,
highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work
underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational
safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in
critical systems.

*Danush Khanna,Krishna Kumar,Basab Ghosh,Vinija Jain,Vasu Sharma,Aman Chadha,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLM对齐中的几何盲点，提出ALKALI基准和GRACE框架以应对潜在伪装攻击，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM防御无法快速应对对抗性威胁，尤其是潜在伪装攻击，需要新的方法和工具来提升安全性。

Method: 提出ALKALI基准（包含9000个对抗提示）和GRACE框架（结合偏好学习和潜在空间正则化），并引入AVQI度量潜在对齐失败。

Result: 评估21个LLM显示高攻击成功率，GRACE框架可降低39%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: GRACE和AVQI为LLM安全性提供了新工具，揭示了潜在伪装攻击的漏洞。

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses
can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial
prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe
representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface
level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to
the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated
adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts
across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families.
Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates
(ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying
vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where
adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate
this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware
Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning
with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent
separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion
among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled
embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry
without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.
Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent
alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when
unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens
into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

TL;DR: PropMEND是一种基于超网络的方法，通过元学习修改语言模型损失的梯度，以促进注入知识的传播，从而解决多跳推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术无法支持基于注入知识的推理问题，需要一种方法促进知识传播。

Method: 通过扩展MEND的元目标，修改梯度更新以支持多跳问题回答。

Result: 在RippleEdit数据集上表现优异，多跳问题准确率提升近2倍；在未见实体关系对上也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PropMEND在知识传播方面表现良好，但未见关系上的性能下降表明未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject
knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on
propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require
reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach
for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify
gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to
propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that
gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop
questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the
RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop
questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We
further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the
generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along
relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still
outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the
performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating
knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically
demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced
costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end

reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we
train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB
memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained
environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing

Motivation: 预训练语言模型在算术运算中容易出错，现有方法未能有效探测数值嵌入的结构，因此需要更准确的探测技术。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的探测技术，能够从输入嵌入中解码数值，并验证其准确性。

Result: 新探测技术能近乎完美地解码数值，证明预训练后的语言模型能精确表示数字；嵌入的精确性与算术错误相关。

Conclusion: 通过调整嵌入结构与探测发现的模式对齐，可以减轻模型的算术错误。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) are prone to arithmetic errors. Existing
work showed limited success in probing numeric values from models'
representations, indicating that these errors can be attributed to the inherent
unreliability of distributionally learned embeddings in representing exact
quantities. However, we observe that previous probing methods are inadequate
for the emergent structure of learned number embeddings with sinusoidal
patterns.
  In response, we propose a novel probing technique that decodes numeric values
from input embeddings with near-perfect accuracy across a range of open-source
LMs. This proves that after the sole pre-training, LMs represent numbers with
remarkable precision. Finally, we find that the embeddings' preciseness judged
by our probe's accuracy explains a large portion of LM's errors in elementary
arithmetic, and show that aligning the embeddings with the pattern discovered
by our probe can mitigate these errors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由器通常采用单轮一对一映射，无法充分利用多个LLM的互补优势，限制了处理复杂任务的能力。

Method: Router-R1将多LLM路由和聚合建模为序列决策过程，利用LLM的推理能力交替执行内部思考和动态模型调用，并通过轻量级规则奖励指导学习。

Result: 在七个通用和多跳QA基准测试中，Router-R1优于多个基线，表现出卓越的性能、泛化能力和成本管理。

Conclusion: Router-R1通过强化学习实现了多LLM的动态路由与聚合，为性能与成本权衡优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the
development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.
However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one
mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),
which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the
complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present
\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that
formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.
Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its
reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with
"route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into
its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based
reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost
reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway
toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions
only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example
performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.
Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1
outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while
maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统尽管可靠性高，但随着可再生能源渗透率的增加，级联停电风险上升，需要快速且复杂的实时决策。

Method: 将影响图扩展为MDP模型，结合强化学习（尤其是策略梯度算法）进行求解，设计了保守决策机制和奖励函数。

Result: 在IEEE 14总线和118总线系统上的验证表明，主动断开某些线路可有效降低级联风险，并识别出关键线路。

Conclusion: 该方法能快速收敛且保守决策，为电力系统级联停电的实时缓解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite high reliability, modern power systems with growing renewable
penetration face an increasing risk of cascading outages. Real-time cascade
mitigation requires fast, complex operational decisions under uncertainty. In
this work, we extend the influence graph into a Markov decision process model
(MDP) for real-time mitigation of cascading outages in power transmission
systems, accounting for uncertainties in generation, load, and initial
contingencies. The MDP includes a do-nothing action to allow for conservative
decision-making and is solved using reinforcement learning. We present a policy
gradient learning algorithm initialized with a policy corresponding to the
unmitigated case and designed to handle invalid actions. The proposed learning
method converges faster than the conventional algorithm. Through careful reward
design, we learn a policy that takes conservative actions without deteriorating
system conditions. The model is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus
systems. The results show that proactive line disconnections can effectively
reduce cascading risk, and certain lines consistently emerge as critical in
mitigating cascade propagation.

Motivation: 随着基于嵌入的搜索在本地设备上的需求增长，高存储开销成为主要障碍，需要一种解决方案来减少存储需求而不影响搜索质量。

Method: LEANN结合紧凑的图结构和动态重计算策略，优化存储和检索效率。

Result: LEANN将索引大小降至原始数据的5%以下，存储需求比标准索引小50倍，同时在真实问答基准上保持90%的top-3召回率和2秒内的延迟。

Conclusion: LEANN为资源受限设备提供了一种高效的近似最近邻搜索解决方案，显著降低了存储需求并保持了搜索性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based search is widely used in applications such as recommendation
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Recently, there is a growing demand
to support these capabilities over personal data stored locally on devices.
However, maintaining the necessary data structure associated with the
embedding-based search is often infeasible due to its high storage overhead.
For example, indexing 100 GB of raw data requires 150 to 700 GB of storage,
making local deployment impractical. Reducing this overhead while maintaining
search quality and latency becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we
present LEANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LEANN combines a
compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation
strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval with minimal storage overhead.
Our evaluation shows that LEANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original
raw data, achieving up to 50 times smaller storage than standard indexes, while
maintaining 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question
answering benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管已有大量RDF标准的知识图，但其丰富的语义信息尚未在基于GNN的推荐系统中得到充分利用。

Result: 实验表明，利用RDF知识图的语义信息显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于GNN的推荐系统在开放数据云中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of
recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand
knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic
information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems.
To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with
GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties
and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an
in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature
initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their
performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple
recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we
demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly
improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender
systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our

Motivation: CBCT在图像引导放疗中存在噪声、软组织对比度低和伪影等问题，而现有方法受限于机构异质性、扫描仪差异和数据隐私法规。

Method: 采用横向联邦学习方法，结合条件生成对抗网络，利用三个欧洲医疗中心的数据进行协作训练。

Conclusion: 该方法技术可行，保护了数据隐私，为跨机构开发通用模型提供了协作解决方案。

Abstract: Shortened Abstract
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become a widely adopted modality for
image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). However, CBCT suffers from increased noise,
limited soft-tissue contrast, and artifacts, resulting in unreliable Hounsfield
unit values and hindering direct dose calculation. Synthetic CT (sCT)
generation from CBCT addresses these issues, especially using deep learning
(DL) methods. Existing approaches are limited by institutional heterogeneity,
scanner-dependent variations, and data privacy regulations that prevent
multi-center data sharing.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a cross-silo horizontal federated
learning (FL) approach for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis in the head and neck region,
extending our FedSynthCT framework. A conditional generative adversarial
network was collaboratively trained on data from three European medical centers
in the public SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset.
  The federated model demonstrated effective generalization across centers,
with mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from $64.38\pm13.63$ to $85.90\pm7.10$
HU, structural similarity index (SSIM) from $0.882\pm0.022$ to $0.922\pm0.039$,
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) from $32.86\pm0.94$ to $34.91\pm1.04$ dB.
Notably, on an external validation dataset of 60 patients, comparable
performance was achieved (MAE: $75.22\pm11.81$ HU, SSIM: $0.904\pm0.034$, PSNR:
$33.52\pm2.06$ dB) without additional training, confirming robust
generalization despite protocol, scanner differences and registration errors.
  These findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of FL for CBCT-to-sCT
synthesis while preserving data privacy and offer a collaborative solution for
developing generalizable models across institutions without centralized data
sharing or site-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting
the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we
systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature
representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and
deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning
techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing
scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model
performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit
descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the
AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore,
for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors
resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as
confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical
guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Abstract: Retrieving homologous protein sequences is essential for a broad range of
protein modeling tasks such as fitness prediction, protein design, structure
modeling, and protein-protein interactions. Traditional workflows have relied
on a two-step process: first retrieving homologs via Multiple Sequence
Alignments (MSA), then training models on one or more of these alignments.
However, MSA-based retrieval is computationally expensive, struggles with
highly divergent sequences or complex insertions & deletions patterns, and
operates independently of the downstream modeling objective. We introduce
Protriever, an end-to-end differentiable framework that learns to retrieve
relevant homologs while simultaneously training for the target task. When
applied to protein fitness prediction, Protriever achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to sequence-based models that rely on MSA-based homolog
retrieval, while being two orders of magnitude faster through efficient vector
search. Protriever is both architecture- and task-agnostic, and can flexibly
adapt to different retrieval strategies and protein databases at inference time
-- offering a scalable alternative to alignment-centric approaches.

*Jiayu Li,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan,Yihong Ma,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: DCIDA是一种用于分布式电路逆设计的框架，通过联合训练的采样策略生成近最优设计，显著降低了设计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有设计方法依赖人工网格、可微分评估和固定拓扑，而实际设计需要非可微分评估、可变拓扑和连续空间。

Method: DCIDA通过联合训练的采样策略生成设计决策，利用注入式映射将原始设计动作转化为物理表示。

Result: 实验表明，DCIDA的Transformer策略在复杂传递函数下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCIDA为分布式电路设计提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate
near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification.
Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies
involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific
template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require
non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and
near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design
exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a
target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound
single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional
distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent
``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent
physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional
dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate
DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in
design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better
fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用CNN和MLP构建替代模型的方法，以减少数值模拟的计算成本，用于近似2D壁域中参与性气体的辐射热传递解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在降低数值模拟的计算成本，同时保持工业可接受的精度。

Method: 通过调整输入以适应CNN架构，创建了两个精度数据集，并使用Optuna优化超参数，比较了CNN和MLP的性能。

Result: 结果显示CNN和MLP均显著提速且误差可接受，CNN在精度和鲁棒性上优于MLP。

Conclusion: CNN在替代模型中表现更优，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Aiming to reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) are
introduced to build a surrogate model to approximate radiative heat transfer
solutions in a 2-D walled domain with participative gases. The originality of
this work lays in the adaptation of the inputs of the problem (gas and wall
properties) in order to fit with the CNN architecture, more commonly used for
image processing. Two precision datasets have been created with the classical
solver, ICARUS2D, that uses the discrete transfer radiation method with the
statistical narrow bands model. The performance of the CNN architecture is
compared to a more classical MLP architecture in terms of speed and accuracy.
Thanks to Optuna, all results are obtained using the optimized hyper parameters
networks. The results show a significant speedup with industrially acceptable
relative errors compared to the classical solver for both architectures.
Additionally, the CNN outperforms the MLP in terms of precision and is more
robust and stable to changes in hyper-parameters. A performance analysis on the
dataset size of the samples have also been carried out to gain a deeper
understanding of the model behavior.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的物理信息机器学习方法（TS-PIELM），用于改进传统PINN在土壤固结分析中的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN在土壤固结分析中的精度和效率不足，需要改进以成为有竞争力的替代方法。

Method: 提出TS-PIELM框架，将固结过程分为多个时间区间，使用单层前馈极限学习机（ELM）近似解，通过线性方程组直接计算输出层权重。

Result: TS-PIELM的计算效率和精度分别提高了1000倍和100倍（一维情况）。

Conclusion: TS-PIELM证明了物理信息机器学习在计算岩土工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Accuracy and efficiency of the conventional physics-informed neural network
(PINN) need to be improved before it can be a competitive alternative for soil
consolidation analyses. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a highly accurate and efficient physics-informed machine learning
(PIML) approach, termed time-stepping physics-informed extreme learning machine
(TS-PIELM). In the TS-PIELM framework the consolidation process is divided into
numerous time intervals, which helps overcome the limitation of PIELM in
solving differential equations with sharp gradients. To accelerate network
training, the solution is approximated by a single-layer feedforward extreme
learning machine (ELM), rather than using a fully connected neural network in
PINN. The input layer weights of the ELM network are generated randomly and
fixed during the training process. Subsequently, the output layer weights are
directly computed by solving a system of linear equations, which significantly
enhances the training efficiency compared to the time-consuming gradient
descent method in PINN. Finally, the superior performance of TS-PIELM is
demonstrated by solving three typical Terzaghi consolidation problems. Compared
to PINN, results show that the computational efficiency and accuracy of the
novel TS-PIELM framework are improved by more than 1000 times and 100 times for
one-dimensional cases, respectively. This paper provides compelling evidence
that PIML can be a powerful tool for computational geotechnics.

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics
from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of
protein structures derived by structural determination methods like
cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning
3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.
For model training, we propose a large-scale dataset of approximately 200,000
protein-caption pairs with rich functional descriptors. We evaluate our model
in both in-domain and more challenging cross-database retrieval on Protein Data
Bank (PDB) and Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) dataset, respectively. In
both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval
performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for
structure-function understanding in protein biology.

Motivation: 探索现代LLM作为文本编码器是否能提升文本到图像生成的效果，替代过时的T5和CLIP。

Method: 构建标准化训练和评估流程，训练27个模型，分析12种文本编码器的嵌入提取方式、LLM变体和模型大小。

Result: 多层归一化平均嵌入显著提升复杂提示的对齐效果，多数LLM优于基线T5模型。

Conclusion: 现代LLM作为文本编码器能提升文本到图像生成性能，尤其是复杂视觉语言推理任务。

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made
significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the
somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we
investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text
encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training
and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of
different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12
different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could
impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract
embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal
that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to
inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and
find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly
improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning
outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced
visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

TL;DR: Mirage是一个音频到视频的基础模型，能够根据音频输入生成逼真、富有表现力的视频。它结合了语音合成技术，实现了多模态视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频创作中音频与视觉的和谐整合至关重要，但现有方法要么忽略音频，要么局限于特定领域（如重新配音）。Mirage旨在填补这一空白，提供通用的音频到视频生成方案。

Method: Mirage采用基于自注意力的统一训练方法，支持从零开始训练或基于现有权重微调。该方法避免了针对特定领域（如语音或图像捕获细节）的架构或损失函数。

Result: Mirage生成的视频在主观质量上优于其他方法，能够根据音频输入生成逼真的表演视频。

Conclusion: Mirage为音频到视频生成提供了通用且高质量的解决方案，展示了自注意力模型在多模态生成中的潜力。

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and
consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the
harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we
see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either
ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation
or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application
domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation
model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from
scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech
synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal
video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and
conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people
delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input
audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training
self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or
given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as
an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior
subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or
loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio
are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage
for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多样性引导的MLP压缩方法（DGMR），显著减少大型视觉Transformer的参数，同时性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型Transformer模型参数过多导致计算和内存成本高昂，研究发现MLP模块占用了大部分参数。

Method: 采用Gram-Schmidt权重剪枝策略消除MLP隐藏层的冗余神经元，同时保留权重多样性以提升蒸馏性能。

Result: 在多个先进的大型视觉Transformer上，方法实现了超过57%的参数和FLOPs减少，且性能几乎无损。

Conclusion: DGMR方法高效压缩模型，显著降低成本，适用于大规模视觉Transformer。

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance
is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model
parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze
popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the
recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP
Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision
transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we
conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons
of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance
recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our
pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large
vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original
performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision
transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter
and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B),
our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without
performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at

Conclusion: Landsat-Bench为Landsat数据提供了标准化评估方法，并验证了SSL4EO-L预训练模型的有效性。

Abstract: The Landsat program offers over 50 years of globally consistent Earth

towards Landsat-based Geospatial Foundation Models (GFM). In this paper, we
introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that
adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and
LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both
common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L
dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract
better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet,
including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理无标定输入、动态场景建模和长期稳定性，StreamSplat旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了静态编码器中的概率采样机制和动态解码器中的双向变形场，用于实时动态3D高斯泼溅表示。

Result: 在静态和动态基准测试中表现优于现有方法，支持任意长度视频流的在线重建。

Conclusion: StreamSplat在重建质量和动态场景建模方面具有优势，且支持实时处理。

Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams
is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods
struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated
inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3)
maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we
introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms
uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering
scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical
innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS
position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic
decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive
experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat
consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic
scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily
long video streams. Code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐蔽物体分割任务因不完全标注数据和物体与背景的相似性而极具挑战性。本文旨在通过统一方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出SEE框架，利用SAM生成伪标签，并通过伪标签生成、存储和监督策略优化训练。同时设计混合粒度特征分组模块提升分割一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SEE在多个ISCOS任务中达到最先进性能，并可作为即插即用方案提升现有模型。

Conclusion: SEE通过伪标签和特征分组模块有效解决了ISCOS的挑战，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves
segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments,
utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for
model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited
supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the
difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which
arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To
tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher
framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment
Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced
by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality
segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label
generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce
informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select
the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring
robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic
similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups
features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering
similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating
more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images.
We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing
the performance of existing models.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection
performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for
small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting
small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer
vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an

method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome
degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance
improvement on the DOTA dataset.

TL;DR: ALTA是一种高效的医学视觉-语言对齐方法，通过适应预训练的视觉模型，显著提升了检索和零样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的跨模态对比学习方法在视觉表示能力上表现不佳，而多模态掩码建模方法虽然视觉表示能力强，但在跨模态匹配上表现不足。ALTA旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: ALTA通过适应预训练的视觉模型（来自掩码记录建模），仅需约8%的可训练参数和不到1/5的计算消耗，实现了高效的视觉-语言对齐。同时，整合了时间多视角放射图像输入以增强信息一致性。

Result: ALTA在文本到图像和图像到文本检索任务中分别比最佳对比方法高出4%和6%的绝对准确率。

Conclusion: ALTA不仅提升了视觉-语言对齐任务的性能，还促进了视觉和语言理解的提升。

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning
shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and
zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive
learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation
capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language
alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked
modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual
representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through
Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes
only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the
computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves
superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and
zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked
record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph
inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their
corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language
alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the
best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image
accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval
accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment
also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如医学影像）部署ML模型时，需要检测训练数据中未见的输入（OOD），但现有方法要么丢弃训练数据，要么假设数据集中存储，这在现实中难以实现。

Method: 提出了Isolation Network框架，通过解决二分类任务量化测试样本与训练数据的分离难度；进一步提出DIsoN，支持在无法共享数据时通过交换模型参数进行比较。

Result: 在四个医学影像数据集上的12个OOD检测任务中，DIsoN表现优于现有方法，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: DIsoN为ML开发者提供了一种新的服务模式，即远程安全利用训练数据进行OOD检测，解决了数据共享的限制。

Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains
such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen
during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent
unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit
from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test
samples and the training data distribution to identify differences.
State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data
after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally
stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This
is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible
due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy
constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework
that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the
training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose
Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of
training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only
model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and
deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target
sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on
four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,
histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against
existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD
detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers
could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of
their training data for OOD detection services. Code will be available upon
acceptance at: *****

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型通常缺乏显式正则化，且与表示学习进展独立发展。本文旨在弥合生成模型与表示学习之间的差距。

Method: 提出Dispersive Loss，一种鼓励隐空间表示分散的正则化方法，无需正样本对，不影响回归采样过程。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上评估，Dispersive Loss在多种模型中均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Dispersive Loss是一种简单有效的正则化方法，有望促进生成模型与表示学习的结合。

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has
largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These
diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally
lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive
Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves
diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal
representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive
self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive
sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used
for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment
(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no
pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate
Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report
consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work
will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation
learning.

Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with
multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved
scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term
performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF)
metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our
objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital
precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the
number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave
channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an
analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital
precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we
propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms,
followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight
the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed
approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the
specific criteria within a given scenario.

### [183] [Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08616)
*Julien Fageot,Peva Blanchard,Gilles Bareilles,Lê-Nguyên Hoang*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的线性广义Bradley-Terry模型，确保偏好学习的单调性，并在数据有限时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习模型（如大型语言模型）缺乏单调性保证，而广义Bradley-Terry模型虽单调但无法泛化到未比较数据。

Method: 提出线性广义Bradley-Terry模型与扩散先验，并识别嵌入条件的充分性以保证单调性。

Result: 实验表明，单调性并非普遍保证，新模型在有限数据集下显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 新模型在保证单调性的同时具备泛化能力，尤其适用于数据受限场景。

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another
alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is,
the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps
surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models,
including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the
only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be
monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable
to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding
of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we
propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion
Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that
guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from
being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models
improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于铁电域开关研究，还可推广到其他复杂非可微设计空间的探索。

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of
a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local
microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based
spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective
kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing
switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to
automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework
efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations
and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect
distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects
abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto
physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and
proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning,
but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching
phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach
provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex,
non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in
molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging
modalities.

Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and
functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often
well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always
consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by
major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving
insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems,
benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient
and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new
APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics
for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation.
Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the
impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization.
Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML
researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel
solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for
instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced
benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth
and standardized workflows. All related code is available at GitHub:

Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成模型在训练数据、建模范式和架构选择上差异显著，导致公平评估和性能影响因素分析困难，本文专注于建模范式的影响。

Method: 通过相同数据集、训练配置和类似骨干架构，对比自回归解码和条件流匹配两种范式，评估生成质量、推理鲁棒性、可扩展性等。

Result: 揭示了两种范式的优缺点，为未来文本到音乐生成系统的设计和训练提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 研究为建模范式的选择提供了依据，有助于优化文本到音乐生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize
high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to
fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)
systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets,
modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates
efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most
influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important,
in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a
systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into
associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future
text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably
most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional
Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from
scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone
architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including
generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,
adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing
capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds
light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing
actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions
in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation. Audio sampled examples

Method: TIP-Search通过离线分析延迟和泛化性能，在线进行任务感知选择，无需依赖明确的输入域标签。

Result: 在三个真实订单簿数据集上测试，TIP-Search比静态基线方法准确率提高8.5%，且100%满足截止时间。

Result: 实验表明，SafeCoT显著减少了过度拒绝并提升了泛化能力，即使在有限训练数据下。

Conclusion: SafeCoT为视觉语言模型的安全对齐提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs)
remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios.
We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages
rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in
VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or
complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about
safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances
generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable
solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

Conclusion: FedTAIL通过优化协调、类感知正则化和条件对齐，在集中式和联邦式设置中均有效提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on
unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While
recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,
existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and
conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain
generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through
sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a
gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and
adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class
imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a
curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes
underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution
alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy
regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies
optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional
alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive
evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that
FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of
domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both
centralized and federated settings. Code: https://github.com/sunnyinAI/FedTail

Motivation: 传统基于观测数据的因果发现方法存在局限性，而基于知识的因果发现（利用变量元数据）是一种有潜力的替代方案。然而，现有LLM方法的结果不稳定且不一致，影响了可靠性。

Method: 通过知识图谱识别信息丰富的元路径子图，并利用学习排序模型优化子图选择，将排名靠前的子图融入零样本提示中，提升LLM的因果推理能力。

Result: 在生物医学和开放领域数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数上比大多数基线方法高出44.4分，且适用于多种LLM和KG。

Conclusion: 结合KGs和LLMs的方法显著提升了基于知识的因果发现的性能和可靠性，为复杂系统中的因果推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for
understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based
causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning
over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a
compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data.
However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce
unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal
inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery.
Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and
further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based
models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts,
improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship.
Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores,
evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs. Our code and datasets are available on

Result: 新模型在交通工程相关指标上优于先前模型。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的模拟方法为交通交叉路口的行为模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: MasHost是首个基于强化学习的自主MAS图构建框架，显著提升了MAS的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently
emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However,
existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted
interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and
constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas
construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of
semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By
formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost
jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified
probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives
pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and
novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we
propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy
that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise
rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven
framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive
baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Conclusion: 提出的ReLU基二次化方法为复杂机器学习问题的量子退火应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization
problems whose objective functions are represented by Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations. For broader applicability of QA,
quadratization methods are used to transform higher-order problems into QUBOs.
However, quadratization methods for complex problems involving Machine Learning
(ML) remain largely unknown. In these problems, strong nonlinearity and dense
interactions prevent conventional methods from being applied. Therefore, we
model target functions by the sum of rectified linear unit bases, which not
only have the ability of universal approximation, but also have an equivalent
quadratic-polynomial representation. In this study, the proof of concept is
verified both numerically and analytically. In addition, by combining QA with
the proposed quadratization, we design a new black-box optimization scheme, in
which ML surrogate regressors are inputted to QA after the quadratization
process.

Abstract: While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which
explicitly depend on model parameters. Thus, they give rise to a
regularization-based training approach for robust and generalizable quantum

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body
systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to
the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size.
Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously
output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in
an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum
excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the
states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate,
through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all
interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing
multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition,
we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting
trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying
all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited
states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states,
which closely match recent experimental observations that the
quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical
ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law
decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap
scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and
efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum
many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking
quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has shown promise for high-dimensional data
analysis, yet many existing approaches rely on linear unitary operations and
shared trainable parameters across outputs. These constraints limit
expressivity and scalability relative to the multi-layered, non-linear
architectures of classical deep networks. We introduce superposed parameterised
quantum circuits to overcome these limitations. By combining flip-flop quantum
random-access memory with repeat-until-success protocols, a superposed
parameterised quantum circuit embeds an exponential number of parameterised
sub-models in a single circuit and induces polynomial activation functions
through amplitude transformations and post-selection. We provide an analytic
description of the architecture, showing how multiple parameter sets are
trained in parallel while non-linear amplitude transformations broaden
representational power beyond conventional quantum kernels. Numerical
experiments underscore these advantages: on a 1D step-function regression a
two-qubit superposed parameterised quantum circuit cuts the mean-squared error
by three orders of magnitude versus a parameter-matched variational baseline;
on a 2D star-shaped two-dimensional classification task, introducing a
quadratic activation lifts accuracy to 81.4% and reduces run-to-run variance
three-fold. These results position superposed parameterised quantum circuits as
a hardware-efficient route toward deeper, more versatile parameterised quantum
circuits capable of learning complex decision boundaries.

### [197] [Physics-Informed Teleconnection-Aware Transformer for Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08049)
*Tengfei Lyu,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: TelePiT是一种新型深度学习架构，通过整合多尺度物理和遥相关意识，显著提升了全球次季节到季节（S2S）预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: S2S预测面临大气系统混沌动力学和多尺度复杂交互的挑战，现有方法未能明确建模关键物理过程和遥相关。

Method: TelePiT包含三个关键组件：球谐嵌入、多尺度物理信息神经ODE和遥相关感知Transformer。

Result: 实验显示TelePiT显著优于现有数据驱动模型和数值天气预报系统，如2米温度RMSE降低57.7%。

Conclusion: TelePiT通过多尺度物理和遥相关建模，为S2S预测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions
from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to
the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across
multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying
physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We
introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S
forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection
awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical
Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto
spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which
explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable
frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical
global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns
into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and
operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements
for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter
temperature compared to previous best models.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution
shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due
to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to
standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have
yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust
solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of
deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation
techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem
peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific
method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure
is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models.
Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing
problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of identifying the Pareto Set under
feasibility constraints in a multivariate bandit setting. Specifically, given a
$K$-armed bandit with unknown means $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K \in \mathbb{R}^d$, the
goal is to identify the set of arms whose mean is not uniformly worse than that
of another arm (i.e., not smaller for all objectives), while satisfying some
known set of linear constraints, expressing, for example, some minimal
performance on each objective. Our focus lies in fixed-confidence
identification, for which we introduce an algorithm that significantly
outperforms racing-like algorithms and the intuitive two-stage approach that
first identifies feasible arms and then their Pareto Set. We further prove an
information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm for
constrained Pareto Set identification, showing that the sample complexity of
our approach is near-optimal. Our theoretical results are supported by an
extensive empirical evaluation on a series of benchmarks.

Abstract: Depth measures are powerful tools for defining level sets in emerging,
non--standard, and complex random objects such as high-dimensional multivariate
data, functional data, and random graphs. Despite their favorable theoretical
properties, the integration of depth measures into regression modeling to
provide prediction regions remains a largely underexplored area of research. To
address this gap, we propose a novel, model-free uncertainty quantification
algorithm based on conditional depth measures--specifically, conditional kernel
mean embeddings and an integrated depth measure. These new algorithms can be
used to define prediction and tolerance regions when predictors and responses
are defined in separable Hilbert spaces. The use of kernel mean embeddings
ensures faster convergence rates in prediction region estimation. To enhance
the practical utility of the algorithms with finite samples, we also introduce
a conformal prediction variant that provides marginal, non-asymptotic
guarantees for the derived prediction regions. Additionally, we establish both
conditional and unconditional consistency results, as well as fast convergence
rates in certain homoscedastic settings. We evaluate the finite--sample
performance of our model in extensive simulation studies involving various
types of functional data and traditional Euclidean scenarios. Finally, we
demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through a digital health
application related to physical activity, aiming to provide personalized
recommendations

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验结果表明，通过重平衡数据集训练随机森林并结合去偏技术，优于直接使用原始数据。

Abstract: Many classification tasks involve imbalanced data, in which a class is
largely underrepresented. Several techniques consists in creating a rebalanced
dataset on which a classifier is trained. In this paper, we study theoretically
such a procedure, when the classifier is a Centered Random Forests (CRF). We
establish a Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the infinite CRF with explicit rates
and exact constant. We then prove that the CRF trained on the rebalanced
dataset exhibits a bias, which can be removed with appropriate techniques.
Based on an importance sampling (IS) approach, the resulting debiased
estimator, called IS-ICRF, satisfies a CLT centered at the prediction function
value. For high imbalance settings, we prove that the IS-ICRF estimator enjoys
a variance reduction compared to the ICRF trained on the original data.
Therefore, our theoretical analysis highlights the benefits of training random
forests on a rebalanced dataset (followed by a debiasing procedure) compared to
using the original data. Our theoretical results, especially the variance rates
and the variance reduction, appear to be valid for Breiman's random forests in
our experiments.

Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in
almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial
for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept
drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on
concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels
of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions.
Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive
models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where
the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We
propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses
classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately
detect concept drifts. We shown empirically that under computational
constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known
methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new drift detection framework to model the
scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show
our how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this
framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU集群规模庞大，软硬件交互复杂，传统方法难以应对大规模模型训练的性能问题。

Method: PerfTracker利用细粒度在线分析，总结运行时行为模式，并通过差分可观测性定位问题根源。

Result: PerfTracker已部署在包含上万GPU的生产集群中，成功诊断多种复杂性能问题。

Conclusion: PerfTracker为大规模模型训练提供了一种高效的性能问题诊断工具。

Abstract: Troubleshooting performance problems of large model training (LMT) is
immensely challenging, due to unprecedented scales of modern GPU clusters, the
complexity of software-hardware interactions, and the data intensity of the
training process. Existing troubleshooting approaches designed for traditional
distributed systems or datacenter networks fall short and can hardly apply to
real-world training systems. In this paper, we present PerfTracker, the first
online troubleshooting system utilizing fine-grained profiling, to diagnose
performance issues of large-scale model training in production. PerfTracker can
diagnose performance issues rooted in both hardware (e.g., GPUs and their
interconnects) and software (e.g., Python functions and GPU operations). It
scales to LMT on modern GPU clusters. PerfTracker effectively summarizes
runtime behavior patterns of fine-grained LMT functions via online profiling,
and leverages differential observability to localize the root cause with
minimal production impact. PerfTracker has been deployed as a production
service for large-scale GPU clusters of O(10, 000) GPUs (product homepage
https://help.aliyun.com/zh/pai/user-guide/perftracker-online-performance-analysis-diagnostic-tool).
It has been used to diagnose a variety of difficult performance issues.
