In contrast, human experts\ntypically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which\naligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose\nCrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.\nSpecifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,\nwhich effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.\nWe further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning\nframework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to\nbetter exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited\ndata.

The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation\nfor signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard\npreprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications."}

We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a \\emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion\npolicies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search\nwithin SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of\nexpert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness\nof SBPs to yield \\emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation\niterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an\nimplementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler\ntrained on a \\emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD\nscenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than\nclassical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.\nDiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other\napproaches by achieving roughly 30\\% higher success rate.

Secondly, we address a common pitfall in\nexisting retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking\ndiversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training\nparadigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality\nand diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss.

Our analysis of\nrecent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\\'c et\nal., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and\nevaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of\nself-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy\nand full-proof validity.\n  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI\ninto the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented\nmathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical\nguidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding\nprinciples for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore\nseven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from\ncreativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these\nprinciples translate into concrete practice.\n  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than\nautomation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,\ncritical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use\nthese powerful tools."}

However, current methods face two major limitations.\nFirst, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which\nstruggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,\nthey largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is\nessential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in\nhandwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot\nhandwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent\ntext from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to\nbetter capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We\nfurther introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages\nhigh-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that\naligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby\nenhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting\ndatasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent\nhandwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource\nhandwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

For a demo\n  video, see https://youtu.be/uobhmxo6EIE", "summary": "As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and\nmore complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their\nconversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users\nbetter manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal\nalignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results\nwith examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to\nnavigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20\nparticipants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat\ninterface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and\neffort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to\novercome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can\nenhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired\ndesign implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal\ncommunication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable\nfeedback to improve LLM performance."}

Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,\nbottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms\ntry-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning\nnetwork that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and\nvideos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is\ntrained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a\nlarger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive\nmanner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions\nand enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience."}
