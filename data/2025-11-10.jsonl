This paper examines the interplay between\nKV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like\nmeta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of\npositional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking\nframework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the\naccumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window\n(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory\nexhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via\nAttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.\nBecause LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a\ncache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to\ndegenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving\ncontiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more\ncoherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate\nfor eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional\nstructure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

To address these issues, we propose two distinct and\ncomplementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging\nenvironment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online\ndistributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by\nlearning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output\ndistribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.\nSecond, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven\nexploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal\ndynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world\nmodel. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,\nincluding function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the\neffectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal\ncomputational cost.

However, it remains challenging due to structural\nbreaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and\nmarket shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,\nhave attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and\nmodeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced\ndeep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization\ncapability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid\nframework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and\nPELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot\nprices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and\npolicy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate\ndatasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing\nforecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by\n70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without\ndecomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value\nof integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep\nlearning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price\nforecasting and other nonstationary financial time series."}

Although these approaches result in impressive reductions\nin compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically\nin-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute\ntradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications\nrequire more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency\nand memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that\nartificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent\nstate update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at\nspecific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design\nprocess, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &\nAttend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two\nsimple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of\ntokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression\nresults in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and\nmemory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for\nefficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,\nunlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without\nany retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive\nevaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and\nlong-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing\nefficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different\ncompute-memory budgets.
