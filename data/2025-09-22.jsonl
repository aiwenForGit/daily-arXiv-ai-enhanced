However,\ntheir static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands\n-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by\nprivacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,\nincluding retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often\ncomputationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or\ncontinuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:\nrethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in\ncapability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies\nknowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than\nencoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics\nto dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by\nremoving the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or\naccess to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves\npredictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten\nones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security\nguarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal\nprevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.\nThis ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against\nunauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for\ndeployment in sensitive and regulated environments.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and\nits variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to\ntraditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a\nnovel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts\nthe batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes\nis more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often\nconverges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling\nDiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training\nwhile improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient\ndiversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the\nconvergence analysis of SGD.

We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nintegrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present\ngeneralization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the\nvalidity of our new evaluation protocols.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to\nsuppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient\nascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such\nsuppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate\nthe underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a\nresponse is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based\nmethods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal\nactivations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the\nactivation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''\nentities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the\nactivation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward\nthose of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the\ntarget's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the\nmodel's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',\nachieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model\ncollapse. Empirically, we show that our method effectively aligns the internal\nactivations of the forgotten target, a result that the suppression-based\napproaches do not reliably achieve.

The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost\nminimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct\nnotions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first\ncarry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps:\ncyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps.

Although recent codecs achieve strong low-bitrate reconstruction and\nprovide powerful representations for downstream tasks, most are non-streamable,\nlimiting their use in real-time applications. We present FocalCodec-Stream, a\nhybrid codec based on focal modulation that compresses speech into a single\nbinary codebook at 0.55 - 0.80 kbps with a theoretical latency of 80 ms. Our\napproach combines multi-stage causal distillation of WavLM with targeted\narchitectural improvements, including a lightweight refiner module that\nenhances quality under latency constraints. Experiments show that\nFocalCodec-Stream outperforms existing streamable codecs at comparable\nbitrates, while preserving both semantic and acoustic information. The result\nis a favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality, downstream task\nperformance, latency, and efficiency. Code and checkpoints will be released at\nhttps://github.com/lucadellalib/focalcodec."}

However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}
