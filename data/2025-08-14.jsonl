Given\nthe rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as\nimportant as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system.

To develop a general system for odor\ndetection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two\nhypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are\nsufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from\nthe olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an\nensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and\nAttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory\nbulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble\nmodel supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score\nof 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous\nbenchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework\ncaptures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the\nfeasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from\nextracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning\nmodels to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations."}

Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their\npractical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical\nover-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for\nassessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their\nmutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four\ngraph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).\nCoupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how\nrewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and\nnode-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These\nfindings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both\nsubstantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,\nor rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and\nmay even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners\ndecide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off."}

However, existing methods\noften evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the\nexponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative\nmodeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage\narchitecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse\nset of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with\nreinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine\nits selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a\nmulti-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as\nclicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to\nprovide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative\nmodel toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading\ne-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising\nrevenue, demonstrating its practical value.

In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize\nsmall, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured\nknowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a\nbiologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of\ntask-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller\nchild model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform\nimitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance\nmechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage\nprocess of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional\ncarriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated\ncomponents: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention\n(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,\nensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision\ntasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),\nand semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves\nchild model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that\nHKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a\ngeneral-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying\nhigh-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments."}

We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by\nusing semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes\ncross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a\nfine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,\npreserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the\nimage into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based\nrepresentation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived\nfrom the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies\ndownstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for\npneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\\% reduction in image data size\nwhile maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming\nother baseline models that use uncompressed data.

The generated data are\nbelieved to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or\nperforming Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space\nhelps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features\naffecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of\ngenerative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\ncombine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse\nprocess of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.\nIn some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for\neach dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each\ndimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different\ndimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs\nimpose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource\nconsumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different\ntemporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring\nthe priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel\nfunctions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent\ndimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed\nStructured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more\nefficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.\nThis research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE\nachieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced\ncomputational burden compared to GP-VAE."}

However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success.
