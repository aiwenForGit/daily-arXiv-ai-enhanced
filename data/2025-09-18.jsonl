Prior approaches focus primarily on\nmeasuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain\nlimited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a\nscalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent\nreasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates\nsynthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in\nmodel-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when\nreasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach\nmodels to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B\nand Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases\nfaithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while\nimproving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points.

However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and\nthe limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation\nreconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant\nchallenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach\nfor model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through\nstructured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set\nto support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a\nhigh-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin\nsounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation,\nWhine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced\nsound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been\nmade publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental\nevaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models\nusing proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection\nstrategies."}

Ablation studies on qubit number and\ncircuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended\nevaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules."}

Prior LLM work has focused on\nsupport systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous\nrecent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting,\ndebt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines\nthat incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected\nfinancial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible\nframework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance\nstudies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this\nframework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive\nfine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test\nsplit and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data\ncuration and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance\ncomparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual\naccuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs\nthan the larger counterparts."}

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant\nperformance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks,\nproviding empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental\nrepresentations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

The average-reward\nformulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts,\nremains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming\nfoundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with\nseveral fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general\nframework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain\nsetting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible\ninformation asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary.\nOur analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining\nboth the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average\nreward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation\ncharacterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide\nsufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence.

The flow dynamics can be time-varying\nand chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and\ncomplex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model\nand predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes\nthat drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally\nintensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is\nlimited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source\nlocalization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element\nmodel of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are\nused to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an\ninfotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to\nmaximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach\nachieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and\nresults in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine\nlearning approaches."}

Based on the analysis of the\nsolution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact\nconditional $p$-values for the selected change-points.
