We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers.\n  Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset.

Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification."}

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size.

Unlike ARMs, where attention converges to a fixed sink, MDMs exhibit dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe.

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy."}

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE. Case studies for the major destination port further illustrate the model's superior accuracy."}

Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings."}

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL."}

In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere.

However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric.

In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates.

Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks."}

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines."}

To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures.

The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix.

We introduce biases, such as overconfidence and loss aversion, into reward structures and decision-making processes and evaluate their performance in simulated and real-world trading environments. Despite its inconclusive or negative results, this study provides insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering valuable lessons for developing robust financial AI systems."}

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage."}

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods."}

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts."}

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance."}

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent."}

Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings."}

Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity."}

We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage.

It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels."}

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems."}

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems."}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale."}

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses."}

Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases."}

A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope.

This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction.

Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

While recent work has addressed this problem (Nguyen et al., 2024), existing algorithms assume prior knowledge of the total delay over agents and still suffer from suboptimal dependence on both the delay and network parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves an improved regret bound of O N $\\sqrt$ d tot + N $\\sqrt$ T  (1-$σ$2) 1/4 , where T is the total horizon, d tot denotes the average total delay across agents, N is the number of agents, and 1 -$σ$ 2 is the spectral gap of the network. Our approach builds upon recent advances in D-OCO (Wan et al., 2024a), but crucially incorporates an adaptive learning rate mechanism via a decentralized communication protocol. This enables each agent to estimate delays locally using a gossip-based strategy without the prior knowledge of the total delay. We further extend our framework to the strongly convex setting and derive a sharper regret bound of O N $δ$max ln T $α$  , where $α$ is the strong convexity parameter and $δ$ max is the maximum number of missing observations averaged over agents. We also show that our upper bounds for both settings are tight up to logarithmic factors.

In amortized inference, substantial computation is invested upfront to train a neural network that can subsequently produce approximate posterior or predictions at negligible marginal cost across a wide range of tasks. At deployment, amortized inference offers substantial computational savings compared with traditional Bayesian procedures, which generally require repeated likelihood evaluations or Monte Carlo simulations for predictions for each new dataset.\n  Despite the growing popularity of amortized inference, its statistical interpretation and its role within Bayesian inference remain poorly understood.

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets.

Our pipeline is reproducible end-to-end, covering feature extraction, multimodal fusion, cougher-independent evaluation, and uncertainty quantification, and it reports a consistent suite of clinically relevant metrics to enable fair comparison. We further quantify performance for cough audio-only and fused (audio + clinical metadata) models, and release the full experimental protocol to facilitate benchmarking. This baseline is intended to serve as a common reference point and to reduce methodological variance that currently holds back progress in the field."}

TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed."}

To address this, we propose AdaJudge, a unified framework that jointly adapts representation and aggregation. AdaJudge first refines backbone representations into a discrimination-oriented space via gated refinement blocks.

Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayesian norm-based bounds have demonstrated particular promise due to their data-dependent nature and their ability to capture algorithmic and geometric properties of learned models. However, most existing results rely on isotropic Gaussian posteriors, heavy use of spectral-norm concentration for weight perturbations, and largely architecture-agnostic analyses, which together limit both the tightness and practical relevance of the resulting bounds. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a unified framework for PAC-Bayesian norm-based generalization by reformulating the derivation of generalization bounds as a stochastic optimization problem over anisotropic Gaussian posteriors. The key to our approach is a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the network outputs with respect to structured weight perturbations, enabling the explicit incorporation of heterogeneous parameter sensitivities and architectural structures. By imposing different structural assumptions on this sensitivity matrix, we derive a family of generalization bounds that recover several existing PAC-Bayesian results as special cases, while yielding bounds that are comparable to or tighter than state-of-the-art approaches. Such a unified framework provides a principled and flexible way for geometry-/structure-aware and interpretable generalization analysis in deep learning."}

CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL.

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios."}

We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings."}

Recent work using causal mediation analysis has shown that a small set of attention heads encodes task representation in in-context learning, captured in a compact representation known as the function vector. We show that fine-tuning function vectors with only a small set of examples (about 20 word pairs) yields better performance on relation-based word-completion tasks than using the original vectors derived from causal mediation analysis. These improvements hold for both small and large language models. Moreover, the fine-tuned function vectors yield improved decoding performance for relation words and show stronger alignment with human similarity judgments of semantic relations. Next, we introduce the composite function vector - a weighted combination of fine-tuned function vectors - to extract relational knowledge and support analogical reasoning. At inference time, inserting this composite vector into LLM activations markedly enhances performance on challenging analogy problems drawn from cognitive science and SAT benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of activation patching as a controllable mechanism for encoding and manipulating relational knowledge, advancing both the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of large language models."}

To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly.

However, SPIN is designed to optimize the current reward advantages of annotated responses over synthetic responses at hand, which may gradually vanish during iterations, leading to unstable optimization. Moreover, the utilization of reference policy induces a misalignment issue between the reward formulation for training and the metric for generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Triplet-based Self-Play fIne-tuNing (T-SPIN) method that integrates two key designs. First, beyond current advantages, T-SPIN additionally incorporates historical advantages between iteratively generated responses and proto-synthetic responses produced by the initial policy. Even if the current advantages diminish, historical advantages remain effective, stabilizing the overall optimization. Second, T-SPIN introduces the entropy constraint into the self-play framework, which is theoretically justified to support reference-free fine-tuning, eliminating the training-generation discrepancy. Empirical results on various tasks demonstrate not only the superior performance of T-SPIN over SPIN, but also its stable evolution during iterations. Remarkably, compared to supervised fine-tuning, T-SPIN achieves comparable or even better performance with only 25% samples, highlighting its effectiveness when faced with scarce annotated data."}

Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input.

An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks.

But learning good features often is computationally expensive in machine learning settings and is especially difficult when there is a lack of data. One-shot learning is one such area where only limited data is available. In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition.

Deep surrogate models provide a rapid alternative, yet their generalization across subjects under limited pose and load inputs remains unclear. It remains unclear whether the dominant source of prediction uncertainty arises from temporal history dependence or spatial propagation dependence. Methods:To disentangle these factors, we employed a shared MGN backbone with a fixed mesh topology. A dataset of running trials from nine subjects was constructed using an OpenSim-FEBio workflow. We developed four model variants to isolate specific dependencies: (1) a baseline MGN; (2) CT-MGN, incorporating a Control Transformer to encode short-horizon history; (3) MsgModMGN, applying state-conditioned modulation to message passing for adaptive propagation; (4) CT-MsgModMGN, combining both mechanisms. Models were evaluated using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects.Results:The models incorporating history encoding significantly outperformed the baseline MGN and MsgModMGN in global accuracy and spatial consistency. Crucially, the CT module effectively mitigated the peak-shaving defect common in deep surrogates, significantly reducing peak stress prediction errors. In contrast, the spatial propagation modulation alone yielded no significant improvement over the baseline, and combining it with CT provided no additional benefit.Conclusion:Temporal history dependence, rather than spatial propagation modulation, is the primary driver of prediction uncertainty in cross-subject knee contact mechanics. Explicitly encoding short-horizon driver sequences enables the surrogate model to recover implicit phase information, thereby achieving superior fidelity in peak-stress capture and high-risk localization compared to purely state-based approaches."}

Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability."}

To address these challenges, we propose Latent-GRPO, a framework that derives intrinsic rewards directly from latent space geometry. Crucially, our empirical analysis reveals a compelling geometric property: terminal token representations of correct reasoning trajectories form dense clusters with high intra-class similarity, whereas incorrect trajectories remain scattered as outliers. In light of this discovery, we introduce the Iterative Robust Centroid Estimation (IRCE) algorithm, which generates dense, continuous rewards by mitigating magnitude fluctuations via spherical projection and estimating a robust ``truth centroid'' through iterative aggregation. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method maintains model performance while achieving a training speedup of over 2x compared to baselines. Furthermore, extensive results demonstrate strong generalization ability and robustness. The code will be released soon."}

As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC."}

To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications."}

While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization."}

To address this, we propose STAR (State-Transition Amplification Ratio), a framework that detects backdoors by analyzing output probability shifts. STAR exploits the statistical discrepancy where a malicious input-induced path exhibits high posterior probability despite a low prior probability in the model's general knowledge.

However, the rising operational energy consumption has emerged as a critical bottleneck and a major sustainability concern. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a well-known technique used to reduce energy consumption, and thus improve energy-efficiency, since it requires little effort and works with existing hardware. Reducing the energy consumption of training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) through DVFS or power capping is feasible: related work has shown energy savings can be significant, but at the cost of significant slowdowns. In this work, we focus on reducing waste in LLM operations: i.e., reducing energy consumption without losing performance. We propose a fine-grained, kernel-level, DVFS approach that explores new frequency configurations, and prove these save more energy than previous, pass- or iteration-level solutions. For example, for a GPT-3 training run, a pass-level approach could reduce energy consumption by 2% (without losing performance), while our kernel-level approach saves as much as 14.6% (with a 0.6% slowdown). We further investigate the effect of data and tensor parallelism, and show our discovered clock frequencies translate well for both. We conclude that kernel-level DVFS is a suitable technique to reduce waste in LLM operations, providing significant energy savings with negligible slow-down."}

Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation."}

Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition.

Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

Building on the computational paradigm of learning in the limit, we formalize the tasks of safe language identification and generation. We prove that under this model, safe language identification is impossible, and that safe language generation is at least as hard as (vanilla) language identification, which is also impossible. Last, we discuss several intractable and tractable cases."}

We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

In contrast, decades of work in metaheuristics have shown that maintaining and evolving populations of solutions improves robustness and exploration, and often leads to stronger performance. To close this gap, we study how to make NCO explicitly population-based by learning policies that act on sets of candidate solutions. We first propose a simple taxonomy of population awareness levels and use it to highlight two key design challenges: (i) how to represent a whole population inside a neural network, and (ii) how to learn population dynamics that balance intensification (generating good solutions) and diversification (maintaining variety). We make these ideas concrete with two complementary tools: one that improves existing solutions using information shared across the whole population, and the other generates new candidate solutions that explicitly balance being high-quality with diversity. Experimental results on Maximum Cut and Maximum Independent Set indicate that incorporating population structure is advantageous for learned optimization methods and opens new connections between NCO and classical population-based search."}

For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions."}

While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.\n  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.

Parallel, subdomain-local quasi-Newton corrections are then constructed on the corresponding local parts of the architecture. A key feature is a novel nonlinear multi-preconditioning mechanism, in which subdomain corrections are optimally combined through the solution of a low-dimensional subspace minimization problem.

In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\\cos(\\bmω^{\\top}Δ\\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\\bm{x}_i,\\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy."}

However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs."}

Code available at https://github.com/GMLR-Penn/Multiplex-Thinking", "summary": "Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model.
