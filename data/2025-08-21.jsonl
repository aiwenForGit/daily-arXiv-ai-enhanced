While traditional anomaly detection methods\nprimarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at\nhome at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in\ncollective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home\nalone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.\nUnlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling\nspatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to\ncapture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first\nformulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences\n(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event\nsequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention\nmechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions\nacross multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior\ndata through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to\ndetect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies\nand absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior\nwork. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that\nCoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving\nan improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies.

Methods have been proposed to improve\ngeneralization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning\nto fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and\ncomputation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of\nparameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This\nmethod builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting\nthis approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We\nreframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a\nset of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity\nof task-specific parameters to the global ones.

We begin by\nexamining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which\nprevious work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using\nintervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for\npreserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,\nDeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for\nGPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while\nthis holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond\npunctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,\nsubjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static\nsummaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to\nchanges in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we\ninvestigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by\nLLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping\nexperiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal\nquantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new\ninsight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs\nand have implications for interpretability."}

Recent works have\nhighlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks\noutside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches\nhave investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained\nbackbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach\nthat fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion\nprediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature\nextractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a\nlearnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio\nfeatures, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the\ntranscript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.\nTo efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information.

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM.

The findings suggest that\nalthough LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of\nsoftware defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.\nThese defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared\nweaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code\ngeneration methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded\npasswords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple\nmodels. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in\norder to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation\nbetween a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit\ntests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by\nthe number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the\nfunctional tests.
