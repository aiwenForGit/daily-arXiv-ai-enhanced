This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,\ndesigned to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed\nto the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve\nenergy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing\nenergy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed\nsystem was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying\ntheft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power\nconsumption reduction exceeding 64\\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy\nand consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more\nenergy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart\ngrids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve\nmarginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment\nconsiderations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results\nhighlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring\nsystems within modern smart grid infrastructures."}

To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting.

To address these issues, we propose a\nfrequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale\nspectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low\nfrequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both\nlocal fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental\nresults show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions\nof up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.\nThe framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term\ntrends while reducing computational complexity.

This novel approach streamlines the\niterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant\ncalculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the\ndependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and\nefficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel\n(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian\nProcesses. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the\nexpected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,\nbypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further\nreduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture\nintricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and\ngraph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve\nperformance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational\nefficiency.

However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge.

However,\nthis results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further\nchallenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks."}

A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation.

To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP).

The estimation of particle size distributions is\ncommonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an\nill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise\nand limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to\nregularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the\nGaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using\na pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent\noptimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral\nexpansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace\noperator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy.

Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the\neccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the\nlong-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO\nformation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address\nthis question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven\napproach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how\nour model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical\nhistory, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.\nIn fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)\npredicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then\nshow how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is\nthe root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way\naround. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying\ndynamical property, most likely their formation location.

The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data.

A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible\ncorrect model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard\ninformation criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.\n  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information\ncriterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\\mathcal{B}\n\\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of\ncandidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model\n($n_\\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance\nthreshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more\nparameters than necessary when comparing many models.\n  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for\nSDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,\ncross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model\nidentification and predictive capability.\n  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals\n($\\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\\sigma$), which can impair model learning\nand selection capabilities.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice.

We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models.

We explain the universal\nembedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions\nof given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural\nODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural\ndelay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks\ndynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent\nand study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis\nto the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,\nalso in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias.

However, existing LiDAR representation strategies\noften overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term\nimage-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer\nrange temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA\ncomprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns\nand fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a\nmore unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature\nPropagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image\nfeatures, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;\nand 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency\nacross driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA\nmaintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational\noverhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nLiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves\nboth LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work\ninspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code\nhas be made publicly accessible for future research."}
