FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous\nstructure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the\nMaximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest\nPath Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates\nthe MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over\nshared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\\times$ speedup in policy\ninference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average\noptimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes.

Mixed-precision\nquantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between\nefficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the\noptimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing\nbit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial\ntraining complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that\naddresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable\ndifferentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model\nweights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs,\nenabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter\nsplitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the\nsimultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency.\nExperimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable\nparameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous\nbit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression\nrates.

A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language\nmodel fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget\nwhere it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation\nexperiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers\nperplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream\nutility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of\nthe gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same\n($\\epsilon$, $\\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility\nto membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks."}

The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the\ndatasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second\napproach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset,\nthen aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally\ncomputes a consensus amongst them.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.

Factors influencing the\ndrift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods.\nBalancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address\nconcept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware\nlandscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and\nconcept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables\nsince hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm\nconfigurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated\npromising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift,\nhighlighting the need for further investigation."}

However, the large number of layers and\nmillions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train,\nrequiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that\nintegrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our\napproach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance\nsampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We\nfurther develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly\ninto the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This\nintegration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but\nalso enhances accuracy and efficiency.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds\nfor FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally\nefficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing\nestimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation,\neliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus\nreducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation\nproperties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the\nproposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart.\nNumerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel\nprincipal component analysis.

Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683).
