Traditional human-based quality\nassurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth.\nWhile automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games,\nextending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional\nsensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present\nVRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR\nenvironments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time\nmanner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action\nChunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables\nour agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse\nenvironments. To balance responsiveness and precision, we introduce a\ndynamically adjustable sliding horizon that adapts the agent's temporal context\nat runtime. We evaluate VRScout on commercial VR titles and show that it\nachieves expert-level performance with only limited training data, while\nmaintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer-grade hardware.

In Germany, only 17.3% of hourly heavy rain\nevents between 2001 and 2018 were recorded by rain gauges, highlighting the\nlimitations of traditional monitoring systems. Radar data are another source\nthat effectively tracks ongoing precipitation; however, forecasting the\ndevelopment of heavy rain using radar alone remains challenging due to the\nbrief and unpredictable nature of such events. Our focus is on evaluating the\neffectiveness of fusing satellite and radar data for nowcasting. We develop a\nmultimodal nowcasting model that combines both radar and satellite imagery for\npredicting precipitation at lead times of 5, 15, and 30 minutes. We demonstrate\nthat this multimodal strategy significantly outperforms radar-only approaches.\nExperimental results show that integrating satellite data improves prediction\naccuracy, particularly for intense precipitation. The proposed model increases\nthe Critical Success Index for heavy rain by 4% and for violent rain by 3% at a\n5-minute lead time. Moreover, it maintains higher predictive skill at longer\nlead times, where radar-only performance declines. A qualitative analysis of\nthe severe flooding event in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany in\n2021 further illustrates the superior performance of the multimodal model.\nUnlike the radar-only model, which captures general precipitation patterns, the\nmultimodal model yields more detailed and accurate forecasts for regions\naffected by heavy rain.

Such bad DNNs are uncountably many. In\ncontrast, the insertion of normalization layers provably can reduce the\nLipschitz constant at an exponential rate in the number of normalization\noperations. This exponential reduction yields two fundamental consequences: (1)\nit smooths the loss landscape at an exponential rate, facilitating faster and\nmore stable optimization; and (2) it constrains the effective capacity of the\nnetwork, thereby enhancing generalization guarantees on unseen data. Our\nresults thus offer a principled explanation for the empirical success of\nnormalization methods in deep learning."}

In\nthis paper, we empirically test this assumption and show that it fails to\ndescribe real GPU behavior. By comparing outputs of single-input and batched\nmatmuls, we find that while the i.i.d. model predicts non-zero output\ninstability, empirical results show a 0.00% prediction flip rate. Through\ncovariance analysis, we uncover the cause: the floating-point error is\nstructured and highly correlated. For float16, nearly 50% of the total error\nvariance lies in off-diagonal terms, revealing that the noise behaves as a\ncoordinated, directional perturbation rather than random static.

In terms of this observation, we propose an\nEnergy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt\nembeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is\nimplicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but\nalso rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain\nopen-vocabulary generalization.

We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace\nunrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the\nreliability of standard Kinarm parameters.\n  Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control\nparticipants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the\nfirst 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models,\nfine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We\nrecomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time,\nposture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and\ncompared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1).\n  Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only\n8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded\nreaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA\nimprovements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials\nreplaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability.\n  Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR\nassessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5\nminutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision.

Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical\nguideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base\nmodel, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both\nsafety and fairness."}

By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV\ncache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time\nextrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation\nof arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in\nmotion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster,\nuniquely enabling infinite-length streaming.

This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of\nmulti-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace\ndisentanglement.

Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),\nwhich evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of\ndeterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness\n(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that\npredictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely\nregarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for\nimproving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.\nAmong the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i\nnon-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT\nbaselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to\ncompare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the\nfirst benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by\ndifferent robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common\nAT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,\nincluding clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and\ngeneralization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR\nperformance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by\nPRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training\nmethods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse\nhyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield\nlower GE and higher clean accuracy.

Biconvex\noptimization problems arise in various applications, including machine\nlearning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a\nbiconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods\nbased on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one\nblock of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting\nsubproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and\nimplementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually\nrequires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and\nerror-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to\nbiconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in\na natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem\ncan then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for\nwhich a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users\nto quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without\nexpertise in convex optimization.

Drawing on\nclassical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation,\nadaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial\ncalibration and leaves model parameters unchanged.

When every player employs a no-proximal-regret algorithm in a general\nconvex game, the empirical distribution of play converges to proximal\ncorrelated equilibria (PCE), a refinement of coarse correlated equilibria. Our\nframework unifies several emerging notions in online learning and game theory\n-- such as gradient equilibrium and semicoarse correlated equilibrium -- and\nintroduces new ones. Our main result shows that the classic Online Gradient\nDescent (GD) algorithm achieves an optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ bound on proximal\nregret, revealing that GD, without modification, minimizes a stronger regret\nnotion than external regret.
