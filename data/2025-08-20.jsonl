Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency."}

However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform\neffectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise\ndecreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of\nfirst-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global\nminimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with\nKronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high\ndamping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively\nwashes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,\nreducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent.

Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing\nof evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our\nexperiments."}

This has led to an\nintensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique\nthat hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of\nany steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering\nthe original video quality while maintaining high efficiency.

To better understand H-theorem and its relation to the\narrow of time, we study the equilibration of randomly oriented and positioned\nhard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the\nDeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle\nlabels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional."}

This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific\ntasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently\noverlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned\nLLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of\nexecuting harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned\nto execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix\nINjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends\nautomatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding\nthem to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.\nSpecifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)\ngenerating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task\nperformance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING\nsignificantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing\ntheir effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting\napproaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation\ntasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that\nprefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance\ngains.
