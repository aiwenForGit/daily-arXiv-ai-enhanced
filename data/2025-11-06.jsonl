However, these contests do not reflect\nthe depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced\nmathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each\nwith 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a\ndifficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD\nqualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both\nPhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our\nevaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a\nstark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%\n(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals\nthat models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their\nability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common\nerrors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative\nstudy shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection\nthan general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language\nstage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that\nestablishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal\nmathematical reasoning."}

We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms\nthat drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional\nproblems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion\ndetection, and generative-model validation.

Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent\nconnectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel\ntransformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed\nphase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides\na principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed\ncoordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the\nreservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters\nsuch as spectral radius and leaking rate.

Extended version with supplementary material", "summary": "Emotions are fundamental to the creation and perception of music\nperformances. However, achieving human-like expression and emotion through\nmachine learning models for performance rendering remains a challenging task.\nIn this work, we present SyMuPe, a novel framework for developing and training\naffective and controllable symbolic piano performance models. Our flagship\nmodel, PianoFlow, uses conditional flow matching trained to solve diverse\nmulti-mask performance inpainting tasks. By design, it supports both\nunconditional generation and infilling of music performance features. For\ntraining, we use a curated, cleaned dataset of 2,968 hours of aligned musical\nscores and expressive MIDI performances. For text and emotion control, we\nintegrate a piano performance emotion classifier and tune PianoFlow with the\nemotion-weighted Flan-T5 text embeddings provided as conditional inputs.\nObjective and subjective evaluations against transformer-based baselines and\nexisting models show that PianoFlow not only outperforms other approaches, but\nalso achieves performance quality comparable to that of human-recorded and\ntranscribed MIDI samples. For emotion control, we present and analyze samples\ngenerated under different text conditioning scenarios. The developed model can\nbe integrated into interactive applications, contributing to the creation of\nmore accessible and engaging music performance systems."}

Guided by this insight, we propose a\nsupport-set algorithm preserving strictly the feasibility of iterates. A\ncentral ingredient is a strategically devised update scheme for support sets\nthat adjusts the placement of nonzero entries. We establish the global\nconvergence of the support-set algorithm to a first-order stationary point, and\nshow that its iteration complexity required to reach an $\\epsilon$-approximate\nfirst-order stationary point is $O (\\epsilon^{-2})$.

Experiments were\ncarried out on a Codevintec CK-14e ASV in the towing tank of CNR-INM, under\nboth irregular and regular head-sea wave conditions. The ASV under\ninvestigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses\ndue to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven\nreduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring\nloads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of\nvessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware\ncharacterization of the model response by accounting for variability in\nhyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated\nthat both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular\nand irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based\nROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification,\ndemonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea\ncondition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in\nreproducing vessel dynamics."}

This motivates our\ninvestigation into how properties of algorithm-distribution pairs can affect\nthe choice for the number of folds in $k$-fold cross-validation.\n  Our results consist of a novel decomposition of the mean-squared error of\ncross-validation for risk estimation, which explicitly captures the\ncorrelations of error estimates across overlapping folds and includes a novel\nalgorithmic stability notion, squared loss stability, that is considerably\nweaker than the typically required hypothesis stability in other comparable\nworks.\n  Furthermore, we prove:\n  1. For every learning algorithm that minimizes empirical error, a minimax\nlower bound on the mean-squared error of $k$-fold CV estimating the population\nrisk $L_\\mathcal{D}$: \\[ \\min_{k \\mid n}\\; \\max_{\\mathcal{D}}\\;\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\big(\\widehat{L}_{\\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} -\nL_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big)^{2}\\right] \\;=\\; \\Omega\\!\\big(\\sqrt{k}/n\\big), \\] where\n$n$ is the sample size and $k$ the number of folds.

Deep learning-based beamforming offers an\nalternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to\nbeamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel\nenvironments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their\nability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency.

Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.
