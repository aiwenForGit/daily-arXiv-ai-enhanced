They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world."}

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents."}

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation.

CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale."}

In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF."}

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data."}

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks."}

How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF.

In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks."}

Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts."}

Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures.

Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability.

The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios.

The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator. The valid generation rate stabilizes at 50.6 percent (peaking at 74.5 percent), while mean first-epoch accuracy rises from 28.06 percent to 50.99 percent, and the fraction of candidates exceeding 40 percent accuracy grows from 2.04 percent to 96.81 percent.

To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available."}

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments."}

We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference.

In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation."}

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability."}

RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation.

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime. These findings deepen our understanding of the interplay between optimization dynamics, spectral bias, and the phases of neural network learning."}

We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines."}

We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems."}

FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3).

Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies.

Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN."}

These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems."}

We evaluate the robustness of a hybrid quantum machine learning model, quanvolutional neural networks (QNNs) against classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under four acoustic corruptions (Gaussian noise, pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation) in a clean-train/corrupted-test regime. Using AVFAD (voice pathology) and TESS (speech emotion), we compare three QNN models (Random, Basic, Strongly) to a simple CNN baseline (CNN-Base), ResNet-18 and VGG-16 using accuracy and corruption metrics (CE, mCE, RCE, RmCE), and analyze architectural factors (circuit complexity or depth, convergence) alongside per-emotion robustness. QNNs generally outperform the CNN-Base under pitch shift, temporal shift, and speed variation (up to 22% lower CE/RCE at severe temporal shift), while the CNN-Base remains more resilient to Gaussian noise. Among quantum circuits, QNN-Basic achieves the best overall robustness on AVFAD, and QNN-Random performs strongest on TESS. Emotion-wise, fear is most robust (80-90% accuracy under severe corruptions), neutral can collapse under strong Gaussian noise (5.5% accuracy), and happy is most vulnerable to pitch, temporal, and speed distortions. QNNs also converge up to six times faster than the CNN-Base.

Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios."}

Traditional models, trained on a single class of normal data, struggle with real-world distributions where normal data exhibit diverse patterns, leading to class imbalance and long-tailed anomaly score distributions (LTD). This imbalance skews model training and degrades detection performance, especially for minority instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel importance-weighted loss designed specifically for anomaly detection. Compared to the previous method for LTD in classification, our method does not require prior knowledge of normal data classes. Instead, we introduce a weighted loss function that incorporates importance sampling to align the distribution of anomaly scores with a target Gaussian, ensuring a balanced representation of normal data. Extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets and three real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach in mitigating LTD-induced bias.

Recent defenses attempt to prevent unauthorized cloning by embedding protective perturbations into speech to obscure speaker identity while maintaining intelligibility. However, adversaries can apply advanced purification techniques to remove these perturbations, recover authentic acoustic characteristics, and regenerate cloneable voices. Despite the growing realism of such attacks, the robustness of existing defenses under adaptive purification remains insufficiently studied.\n  Most existing purification methods are designed to counter adversarial noise in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems rather than speaker verification or voice cloning pipelines. As a result, they fail to suppress the fine-grained acoustic cues that define speaker identity and are often ineffective against speaker verification attacks (SVA). To address these limitations, we propose Diffusion-Bridge (VocalBridge), a purification framework that learns a latent mapping from perturbed to clean speech in the EnCodec latent space. Using a time-conditioned 1D U-Net with a cosine noise schedule, the model enables efficient, transcript-free purification while preserving speaker-discriminative structure. We further introduce a Whisper-guided phoneme variant that incorporates lightweight temporal guidance without requiring ground-truth transcripts. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing purification methods in recovering cloneable voices from protected speech. Our findings demonstrate the fragility of current perturbation-based defenses and highlight the need for more robust protection mechanisms against evolving voice-cloning and speaker verification threats."}

To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks."}

VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \\[ \\mathcal{L}u = f \\quad \\text{in} \\quad Q=Ω\\times(0,T), \\] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space-time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \\[ u_N(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\\,φ_n(x,t), \\] where $φ_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling."}

Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal."}

To address these challenges, SWaRL employs a reinforcement learning-based co-training framework that uses compiler feedback for functional correctness and a jointly trained confidential verifier as a reward signal to maintain watermark detectability. Furthermore, SWaRL employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) during fine-tuning, allowing the learned watermark information to be transferable across model updates. Extensive experiments show that SWaRL achieves higher watermark detection accuracy compared to prior methods while fully maintaining watermarked code functionality. The LoRA-based signature embedding steers the base model to generate and solve code in a watermark-specific manner without significant computational overhead.

First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales.

Cluster-specific weights rebalance the classical FCM criterion so that smaller clusters are not overwhelmed by dominant groups, and the weighted objective induces a normalized density model with scale parameter $σ$ and fuzziness parameter $m$.

However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -- including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction -- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs."}

CIR leverages black-box machine learning models to estimate outcome distributions through interquantile ranges, transforming these estimates into compact prediction intervals while achieving approximate conditional coverage. We further propose CIR+ (Conditional Interquantile Regression with More Comparison), which enhances CIR by incorporating a width-based selection rule for interquantile intervals. This refinement yields narrower prediction intervals while maintaining comparable coverage, though at the cost of slightly increased computational time. Both methods address key limitations of existing distributional conformal prediction approaches: they handle skewed distributions more effectively than Conformalized Quantile Regression, and they achieve substantially higher computational efficiency than Conformal Histogram Regression by eliminating the need for histogram construction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods optimally balance predictive accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches."}

In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional framework for enhancing user-ad representations without increasing model inference or serving complexity. The first dimension examines the impact of incorporating diverse event sources, the second considers the benefits of longer user histories, and the third focuses on enriching data with additional event attributes and multi-modal embeddings. We assess the return on investment (ROI) of our source enrichment framework by comparing organic user engagement sources, such as content viewing, with ad-impression sources. The proposed method can boost the area under curve (AUC) and the slope of scaling curves for ad-impression sources by 1.56 to 2 times compared to organic usage sources even for short online-sequence lengths of 100 to 10K. Additionally, click-through rate (CTR) prediction improves by 0.56% AUC over the baseline production ad-recommendation system when using enriched ad-impression event sources, leading to improved sequence scaling resolutions for longer and offline user-ad representations."}

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way."}

With the rise of artificial intelligence, data-driven gravity inversion methods based on deep learning (DL) possess physical property recovery capabilities that conventional regularization methods lack. However, existing DL methods suffer from insufficient prior information constraints, which leads to inversion models with large data fitting errors and unreliable results. Moreover, the inversion results lack constraints and matching from other exploration methods, leading to results that may contradict known geological conditions. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates prior density well logging information to address the above issues. First, we introduce a depth weighting function to the neural network (NN) and train it in the weighted density parameter domain. The NN, under the constraint of the weighted forward operator, demonstrates improved inversion performance, with the resulting inversion model exhibiting smaller data fitting errors. Next, we divide the entire network training into two phases: first training a large pre-trained network Net-I, and then using the density logging information as the constraint to get the optimized fine-tuning network Net-II. Through testing and comparison in synthetic models and Bishop Model, the inversion quality of our method has significantly improved compared to the unconstrained data-driven DL inversion method. Additionally, we also conduct a comparison and discussion between our method and both the conventional focusing inversion (FI) method and its well logging constrained variant. Finally, we apply this method to the measured data from the San Nicolas mining area in Mexico, comparing and analyzing it with two recent gravity inversion methods based on DL."}

In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA."}

The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation."}

ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters. As a concrete example, ReASC reduces inference cost by up to 70\\% relative to self-consistency while preserving accuracy on GSM8K using Gemma-3-4B-it."}

VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance."}

The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters."}

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios."}

In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks."}

To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast.

Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings."}

A Systematic Study on African Languages", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.LG"], "comment": "13 pages, 1 figure, 19 tables", "summary": "Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($ρ= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($ρ\\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis."}

Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by using a linear Hamiltonian-based machine learning method which provides a compact quantum representation of classical data via ground state problems for k-local Hamiltonians. We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of the methods by performing experiments on benchmark datasets using up to 50 qubits of an IBM Heron quantum processor."}

Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from examples of ground-truth signals and associated observations. However, in many real-world applications, obtaining ground-truth references for training is expensive or impossible. Self-supervised learning methods offer a promising alternative by learning a solver from measurement data alone, bypassing the need for ground-truth references. This manuscript provides a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods for inverse problems, with a special emphasis on their theoretical underpinnings, and presents practical applications in imaging inverse problems."}
