Moreover,\npatient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data\nacross institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which\nrely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study\nproposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving\nmechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection\nin diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises\nfrom insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for\nneural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient\nleakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is\nintegrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local\ndata, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the\nimpracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across\nvarious medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to\naggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the\nadaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of\ndifferential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using\ndata from different structures, categories, and distributions."}

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face\nseveral limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA\nsequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high\ncomputational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are\ninefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of\ntwo subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing\n(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant\nspecies. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering\npreviously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability\nanalyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing\nto its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational\nmethod and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a\nfoundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA\nannotation."}

Moreover, while each\ntoken activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures\nexhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple\nconsecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity\npattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,\nend-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques\n(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nMoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment\ntechniques.

Next, to promote both\ntoken-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training\nobjectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work."}

The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising\nthe notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety\nof depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.\nTaking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the\nhalfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of\nclassifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the\nset of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of\n\"loss depths\", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or\nlogistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits\ncomputational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as\ntheir fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the\nhigh-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a\nconnection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity\nof the classifiers.

By drawing inspiration\nfrom classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet\nmeasures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies\nfor problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a\nnetwork topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet\nincluding homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic\nprotocols for organization and communication.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity."}
