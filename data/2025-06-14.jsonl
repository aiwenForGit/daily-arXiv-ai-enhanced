However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates\nsuperior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior\nmethods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can\nbe easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

Applied for test data, we show that\nthe prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good\napproximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the\npredictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained\nin the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values\nfor a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,\ncorresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the\nspin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally\nuniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied\nstopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution.

Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,\nwhich emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two\ncritical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans\ngain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to\naccurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model\nadaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those\ninvolving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object\ninteractions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these\ngaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric\nreasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian\nprinciples with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.\nOur experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,\nwe have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid\ndynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's\ncapabilities.

Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that\nneurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing\ndirections in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that\ncapture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely\non dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over\nresidual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs\noften struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as\ntheir learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model.

Experiments on\nLlama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs\nand a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,\nwhile aligning with human-interpretable concepts.

To address this, we\npropose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,\nwhich realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.\nSpecifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with\nNested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency\ncomponents. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels\nof detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token\nefficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on\nImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and\nSpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in\nshaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the\nsampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that\nillustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence."}

Code is at https://github.com/innovatingAI/AutoMind", "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing\nreal-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to\nautomate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world\neffectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined\nworkflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on\nrelatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical\nexpertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this\nwork, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework\nthat overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated\nexpert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an\nagentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores\npossible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically\ntailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data\nscience benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance\nversus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable\neffectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting\nAutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science."}

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated\nstrong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free\nguidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods\nlack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be\napplied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where\nquality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer\nlevel down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads\ngovern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for\niteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,\nenabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In\naddition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected\nhead's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to\ntune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only\nmitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but\nalso enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through\ncompositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale\nDiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,\ndemonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and\nstyle-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of\nattention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable\nspecialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of\neffective perturbation strategies."}
