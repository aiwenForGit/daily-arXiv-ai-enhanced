However, as qualitative and static representations, CLDs are limited\nin their ability to support dynamic analysis and inform intervention\nstrategies. Additionally, quantitative CLD analysis methods like network\ncentrality analysis often lead to false inference. We propose\nDiagrams-to-Dynamics (D2D), a method for converting CLDs into exploratory\nsystem dynamics models (SDMs) in the absence of empirical data. With minimal\nuser input - following a protocol to label variables as stocks,\nflows/auxiliaries, or constants - D2D leverages the structural information\nalready encoded in CLDs, namely, link existence and polarity, to simulate\nhypothetical interventions and explore potential leverage points under\nuncertainty. Results suggest that D2D helps distinguish between high- and\nlow-ranked leverage points. We compare D2D to a data-driven SDM constructed\nfrom the same CLD and variable labeling. D2D showed greater consistency with\nthe data-driven model than network centrality analysis, while providing\nuncertainty estimates and guidance for future data collection. The method is\nimplemented in an open-source Python package and a web-based application to\nsupport further testing and lower the barrier to dynamic modeling for\nresearchers working with CLDs.

However, most existing studies focus on either\nheterogeneity or heterophily in isolation, overlooking the prevalence of\nheterophilic HGs in practical applications. Such ignorance leads to their\nperformance degradation. In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals. Experiments on seven\nreal-world graphs and twenty baselines demonstrate the superior performance of\nAHGNN, particularly in high-heterophily situations."}

Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component.

Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

In this case, the FI often tends to be\ndistributed among all features which are in correlation with the\nresponse-generating signal features. Even worse, if multiple signal features\nare in strong correlation with a noise feature, while being only modestly\ncorrelated with one another, this can result in a noise feature having a\ndistinctly larger FI score than any signal feature. Here we propose local\nsample weighting (losaw) which can flexibly be integrated into many ML\nalgorithms to improve FI scores in the presence of feature correlation in the\ntraining data. Our approach is motivated from inverse probability weighting in\ncausal inference and locally, within the ML model, uses a sample weighting\nscheme to decorrelate a target feature from the remaining features. This\nreduces model bias locally, whenever the effect of a potential signal feature\nis evaluated and compared to others.

In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions.
