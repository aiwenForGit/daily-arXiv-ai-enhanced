MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates\nequally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance\nthroughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows\nthat MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference\nlatency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints.\nCompared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across\nprefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in\nNVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid\nscheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning\ncapabilities on edge platforms."}

Our pipeline achieves\nstate-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7\npoints above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\\sim$0.07 above previous\npublished results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts\nrelation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling\nverification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent\nrisk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized\nagents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise\nachieved by humans alone. Using Bipolar Assumption-Based Argumentation, we\ncapture support/attack relationships, thereby enabling automatic hallucination\ndetection via fact nodes attacking arguments. We also provide a verification\nmechanism that enables iterative refinement through test-time feedback without\nretraining. For easy deployment, we provide a Docker container for the\nfine-tuned AMT model, and the rest of the code with the Bipolar ABA Python\npackage on GitHub."}

Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this\nensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically\nequivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our\nexpansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial\ngrowth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal,\nexplaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep\nmodels.

In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely\ndeployed for a single use case.

A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need\nto be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third\nchallenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in\nsuch settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real\ntime) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous\ntime-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a\nunified framework that addresses these challenges.

We attribute this\nphenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped\ninside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To\naddress this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an\nalgorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes\nthe forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for\nout-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to\nfacilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B\nmodels with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised\nfine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B\ntokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\\eta^{\\ast}, B^{\\ast})$\nconsistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm\ntransfer.

To address these limitations, we propose\nLLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor''\nto an ``algorithmist''. Instead of being exposed to raw data, our framework\nleverages the LLM's ability to reason about algorithms.

To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage.

When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we\nrevisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging\ntraining, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development\nof more advanced reasoning capabilities."}

To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence.

In this research, we have implemented a hybrid CNN-RNN deep learning\nmodel for crash severity prediction and compared its performance against widely\nused statistical and machine learning models such as logistic regression,\nna\\\"ive bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and\nindividual deep learning models: RNN and CNN. This study employs a methodology\nthat considers the interconnected relationships between various features of\ntraffic accidents. The study was conducted using a dataset of 15,870 accident\nrecords gathered over a period of seven years between 2015 and 2021 on Virginia\nhighway I-64. The findings demonstrate that the proposed CNN-RNN hybrid model\nhas outperformed all benchmark models in terms of predicting crash severity.\nThis result illustrates the effectiveness of the hybrid model as it combines\nthe advantages of both RNN and CNN models in order to achieve greater accuracy\nin the prediction process."}

We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting\n(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data\nbased on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a\ncurriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,\nchaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent\nand attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first\ntraining a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more\nchaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable\nrepresentation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum.

Since forking sequences remains largely unknown in the\nbroader neural forecasting community, in this work, we formalize the\nforking-sequences approach, and we make a case for its broader adoption. We\ndemonstrate three key benefits of forking-sequences: (i) more stable and\nconsistent gradient updates during training; (ii) reduced forecast variance\nthrough ensembling; and (iii) improved inference computational efficiency. We\nvalidate forking-sequences' benefits using 16 datasets from the M1, M3, M4, and\nTourism competitions, showing improvements in forecast percentage change\nstability of 28.8%, 28.8%, 37.9%, and 31.3%, and 8.8%, on average, for MLP,\nRNN, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based architectures, respectively."}

On symbolic tasks, specifically Boolean\ncode problems, clause-aligned FPE systematically reduces polysemanticity\nmetrics and yields higher task accuracy.

We derive two novel loss\nfunctions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): the first one penalizes\ninfeasibility (by penalizing when the predicted parameters lead to infeasible\nsolutions), and the second one penalizes suboptimal decisions (by penalizing\nwhen the true optimal solution is infeasible under the predicted parameters).\nWe introduce a single tunable parameter to form a weighted average of the two\nlosses, allowing decision-makers to balance suboptimality and feasibility. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that adjusting this parameter provides a\ndecision-maker the control over the trade-off between the two. Moreover, across\nseveral COP instances, we find that for a single value of the tunable\nparameter, our method matches the performance of the existing baselines on\nsuboptimality and feasibility."}

Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance."}

Recent advances in statistical\nphysics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise\ncharacterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in\ninformation-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent\ncontrol protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that\nminimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we\ndevelop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation\nresponse relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that\noptimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both\nusing FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on\niteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much\neasier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing\nequations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a\ndouble-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to\nconstruct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The\nframework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by\noptimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test,\nthe framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work\ncosts comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide\nprincipled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in\nphysical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates\nrobust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic\nbiological networks."}

Our results show that by making the\nmodel explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a\nstrong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable\nimprovements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable\nmethodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the\ncontext of the narrative."}

While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)\nmethods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance\nvaries. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending\npre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent\nrepresentations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty\nrepresentation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against\neight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention\nrecognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and\nuncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action\nlabels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our\nresults show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution\nclassification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based\nOOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more\nefficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain\nMonte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures."}

In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to\nbillions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms\nunderlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses\nthis question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform\nvarious actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \\textit{push red\ncube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the\nactive inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling\ncuriosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several\nnontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise\nsubstantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler,\nprerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex\nactions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of\nsentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional\ngeneralization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of\ncompositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible\nmechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and\nprovide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology."}

While recent\nstudies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such\ntasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative\ncapacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as\ninstructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired\nby the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general\nThink-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an\nembedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain\ncomplex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations\nconditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This\nexplicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex\nmultimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging\na powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nMMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house\ndatasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune\na smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces,\nachieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain\nover recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating\nthe reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without\nsacrificing performance."}

Using string diagrammatical tools, we can\nexplicitly describe the graphs that serve as consistent abstractions of a\nlow-level graph under interventions.

While recent advances in general motion\ntracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these\npolicies lack the precision and object awareness required for\nloco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual\nlearning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human\nmotion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,\nserves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.\nAn efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT\noutputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further\nfacilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object\ntracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that\nencourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a\ncurriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We\nevaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results\nshow substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness\nover strong baselines.
