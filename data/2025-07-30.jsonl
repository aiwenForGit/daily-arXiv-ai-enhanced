This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach\ninspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice\nand Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall\n(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we\ntermed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the\nmodel's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test\nTFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading\nregularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR\nperforms significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split\nCIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's\n7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,\nwe analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that\nwhile TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay\nvolume is still more effective when available memory is abundant.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the\nInternet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating\nvarious forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second\nchallenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the\ntraining procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and\ncommunication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and\nContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world\nwireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.\nWe will release our code to the community."}

The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce\nnormalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to\nthe law of total probability for classifiers.

The GNN-based discrete choice models\n(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture\ndependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to\nclassical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the\nGNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated\nlogit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic\ninterpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.\nEmpirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural\nnetworks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77\ncommunity areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture\nindividual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.\nOverall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and\nexpressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning\nin the complex spatial choice contexts."}

Staining, also known as\nwatermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to\nidentify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret\ntrigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms\ncan be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning\nor retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their\nworst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly\nmodifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the\n(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small\n`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental\nresults showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical\nperformance on a variety of computer vision models."}

Preliminary report. Feedback welcome!", "summary": "In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a\ntransformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)\ngame. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an\nagent must collect \"coins\" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of\n\"spotlights.\" By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth\ntransform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space\nfor our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better\nmodeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to\npoint. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general\nvolume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry\nout an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent\nrepresentation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while\nfollowing a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the\nagent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the\nenvironmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,\nour work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent\nspace may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games."}

However, their\nability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,\nevolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,\nwe introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in\nmulti-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users\nwho start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,\nrequiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with\ntools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a\nsignificant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For\ninstance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only\n20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer\nthan 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results\nhighlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task\nexecutors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive\nenvironment to measure and advance this critical capability."}

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between\nquantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to\nalleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum\ncomputing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of\nfour different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network\nRepresentation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel\nEnhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding\n(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image\ninformation than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the\nperformance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear\nkernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable\nclassification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for\nimage storage."}
