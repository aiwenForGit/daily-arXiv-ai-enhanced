Existing characterizations of\ncompute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens\nin isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating\npoints. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general\nframework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned\nskill graph.

To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite\ngraph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge\nDS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We\ntheoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy\nscaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies\nas a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior\nelicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;\nand both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified\nanalytical framework.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

The purpose of \\emph{partial label learning}\n(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels\nassociated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of\ndiffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their\npotential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.\nTherefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the\nperspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively\nrefining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model\nto learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the\ngeneration uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label\nfor classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch\nbetween instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a \\emph{diffusion disambiguation model\nfor PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information\nbetween instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial\ndiffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to\nestimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated\nduring the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is\nprogressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage\nof the DDMP and its suitability for PLL."}

For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:\nthey are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive\nlearning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory\nlimits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation\nALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality\nembeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce\nglobal embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of\nentities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message\npassing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream\nmachine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms\nprevious methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base\nembedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware."}

In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and\nefficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow\nmanifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of\nthe slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables\nrestricted to the manifold.

In this report, we share our key\nfindings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We\nfirst develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the\nfinal performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then\nunlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability\nenhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving,\nvideo understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents,\nand long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this\nfield, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation\nacross 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all\ntasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks\nrelative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably,\nGLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance\ncompared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including\nlong document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong\ncapabilities. Code, models and more information are released at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking."}
