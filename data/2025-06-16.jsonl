Unlike GNNs, which\nrequire constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN\nnaturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more\nexpressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as\ncombinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative\nsamples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)\nand a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and\nhypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that\nChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in\nlarge-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical\nplausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for\nreaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed\nframework for accelerating reaction discovery."}

Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not.

Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or\nlocal heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,\nsignal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement\nlearning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle\nspeeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new\nphysical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,\ngap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL\nframework.

Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim\nsimulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput\nby 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared\nto the no-control setting.

In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of\nmulti-dimensionality to linear RNNs.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into\na learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,\nwhich preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich\nsupervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise\ncontributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class\nrebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class\ndistributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage\ncompact and discriminative feature embeddings.

Bridging these ideas, this study\nintroduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that\nrealises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples\nthe resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image\nfeature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated\nangle reuploading.

Existing\nSSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based\nmethods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR\ninputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort\nclinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision\nfor Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework\nfor cardiac ultrasound video representation learning.

Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some\ninput data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.\nYet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations\nrelies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability\ndistribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence\naccount for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have\nbeen previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its\nprobabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical\ndescriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to\nlearn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of\nfaithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this\ntask. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard\nmethods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain\nmeaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom\narrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to\nprior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,\nhighlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the\nstudy of quantum systems."}

As datasets\ncontinue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices\nbecome increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct\nformation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on\nmatrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the\nmatrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,\nor when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can\nbe restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these\ncases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit\noperator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In\nsuch settings, the matrix is \"impalpable,\" in the sense that we have access to\nonly masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory\nto introduce a novel method of \"free decompression\" to estimate the spectrum of\nsuch matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical\nspectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely\nlarge (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full\nmatrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting\ndistributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as\napplying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their\nfull empirical eigenspectra."}

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape\nprogramming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs\ntransformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In\nthis paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs\non code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,\nand similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked\nto arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends\nin the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of\nLLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\\_case variable names\nin Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning\nprocesses. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other\nfactors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the\nproportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results\nprovide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world\nprogramming style."}
