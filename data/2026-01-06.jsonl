Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020)."}

Shrimp farming represents a significant source of income in many regions; however, like other forms of aquaculture, it is severely impacted by disease outbreaks. These diseases pose a major challenge to sustainable shrimp production. To address this issue, automated disease classification methods can offer timely and accurate detection. This research proposes a deep learning-based approach for the automated classification of shrimp diseases. A dataset comprising 1,149 images across four disease classes was utilized. Six pretrained deep learning models, ResNet50, EfficientNet, DenseNet201, MobileNet, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Xception were deployed and evaluated for performance. The images background was removed, followed by standardized preprocessing through the Keras image pipeline. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) was used for enhancing the model robustness through adversarial training. While advanced augmentation strategies, including CutMix and MixUp, were implemented to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. To support interpretability, and to visualize regions of model attention, post-hoc explanation methods such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and XGrad-CAM were applied. Exploratory results demonstrated that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest performance, attaining a 96.88% accuracy on the test dataset. After 1000 iterations, the 99% confidence interval for the model is [0.953,0.971]."}

This study introduces the Intrinsic-Metric Physics-Informed Neural Network (IM-PINN), a mesh-free geometric deep learning framework that solves partial differential equations directly in the continuous parametric domain. By embedding the Riemannian metric tensor into the automatic differentiation graph, our architecture analytically reconstructs the Laplace-Beltrami operator, decoupling solution complexity from geometric discretization. We validate the framework on a \"Stochastic Cloth\" manifold with extreme Gaussian curvature fluctuations ($K \\in [-2489, 3580]$), where traditional adaptive refinement fails to resolve anisotropic Turing instabilities. Using a dual-stream architecture with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, the IM-PINN recovers the \"splitting spot\" and \"labyrinthine\" regimes of the Gray-Scott model. Benchmarking against the Surface Finite Element Method (SFEM) reveals superior physical rigor: the IM-PINN achieves global mass conservation error of $\\mathcal{E}_{mass} \\approx 0.157$ versus SFEM's $0.258$, acting as a thermodynamically consistent global solver that eliminates mass drift inherent in semi-implicit integration.

An offline logged dataset is constructed from SQuAD 2.0 by executing each action and recording accuracy, token cost, hallucination/refusal indicators, and an SLO-weighted reward. Two simple policy-learning objectives are evaluated: supervised classification of the per-state best action (Argmax-CE) and a reward-weighted variant (Argmax-CE-WT).

MFEE operates as a gating layer above existing stacks without modifying models, weights, or parameters. Across 1,000 diverse prompts under deterministic decoding, MFEE achieves 78.1% execution reduction while maintaining 100% exact-match equivalence for invoked executions. Comparative evaluation reveals pattern-based routers achieve at most 53.3% avoidance with correctness failures, while MFEE reaches 100% avoidance with zero failures through semantic analysis. We prove this limitation via Theorem 1: any router operating solely on finite feature maps cannot simultaneously guarantee zero false skips and positive avoidance on feature-collision pairs. These results establish execution governance as a foundational layer in ML systems infrastructure, orthogonal to model-level optimization techniques."}

However, statistical heterogeneity among clients, often manifested as non-IID label distributions, poses significant challenges to convergence and generalization.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{FedSCAM} (Federated Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Clustered Aggregation and Modulation), a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the SAM perturbation radius and aggregation weights based on client-specific heterogeneity scores. By calculating a heterogeneity metric for each client and modulating the perturbation radius inversely to this score, FedSCAM prevents clients with high variance from destabilizing the global model. Furthermore, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware weighted aggregation mechanism that prioritizes updates from clients that align with the global optimization direction.

More recently, Google DeepMind has introduced AlphaEarth Foundation (AEF), a GFM pre-trained using multi-source EOs across continuous time. An annual and global embedding dataset is produced using AEF that is ready for analysis and modeling. The internal experiments show that AEF embeddings have outperformed operational models in 15 EO tasks without re-training. However, those experiments are mostly about land cover and land use classification. Applying AEF and other GFMs to agricultural monitoring require an in-depth evaluation in critical agricultural downstream tasks. There is also a lack of comprehensive comparison between the AEF-based models and traditional remote sensing (RS)-based models under different scenarios, which could offer valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. This study addresses some of these gaps by evaluating AEF embeddings in three agricultural downstream tasks in the U.S., including crop yield prediction, tillage mapping, and cover crop mapping. Datasets are compiled from both public and private sources to comprehensively evaluate AEF embeddings across tasks at different scales and locations, and RS-based models are trained as comparison models. AEF-based models generally exhibit strong performance on all tasks and are competitive with purpose-built RS-based models in yield prediction and county-level tillage mapping when trained on local data. However, we also find several limitations in current AEF embeddings, such as limited spatial transferability compared to RS-based models, low interpretability, and limited time sensitivity. These limitations recommend caution when applying AEF embeddings in agriculture, where time sensitivity, generalizability, and interpretability is important."}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention.

Consider the task of predicting the political preferences of users in a social network; to solve this task one should consider, both, the features of each individual user and the relationships between them. However, oftentimes one is not interested in the label of a single instance but rather in the distribution of labels over a set of instances; e.g., when predicting the political preferences of users, the overall prevalence of a given opinion might be of higher interest than the opinion of a specific person. This label prevalence estimation task is commonly referred to as quantification learning (QL). Current QL methods for tabular data are typically based on the so-called prior probability shift (PPS) assumption which states that the label-conditional instance distributions should remain equal across the training and test data. In the graph setting, PPS generally does not hold if the shift between training and test data is structural, i.e., if the training data comes from a different region of the graph than the test data. To address such structural shifts, an importance sampling variant of the popular adjusted count quantification approach has previously been proposed. In this work, we extend the idea of structural importance sampling to the state-of-the-art KDEy quantification approach. We show that our proposed method adapts to structural shifts and outperforms standard quantification approaches."}

However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications."}

Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find catastrophic failures correlate with single-feature dependence (rho = 0.714, p = 0.047).

However, despite its power, the standard attention mechanism is plagued by well-documented issues: representational collapse and attention sink. Although prior work has proposed approaches for these issues, they are often studied in isolation, obscuring their deeper connection. In this paper, we present a unified perspective, arguing that both can be traced to a common root -- improper attention allocation. We identify two failure modes: 1) Attention Overload, where tokens receive comparable high weights, blurring semantic features that lead to representational collapse; 2) Attention Underload, where no token is semantically relevant, yet attention is still forced to distribute, resulting in spurious focus such as attention sink. Building on this insight, we introduce Lazy Attention, a novel mechanism designed for a more focused attention distribution. To mitigate overload, it employs positional discrimination across both heads and dimensions to sharpen token distinctions. To counteract underload, it incorporates Elastic-Softmax, a modified normalization function that relaxes the standard softmax constraint to suppress attention on irrelevant tokens. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu corpus, evaluated across nine diverse benchmarks, demonstrate that Lazy Attention successfully mitigates attention sink and achieves competitive performance compared to both standard attention and modern architectures, while reaching up to 59.58% attention sparsity."}

To address these challenges, we propose MODE, a unified framework that integrates Low-Rank Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) with an Enhanced Mamba architecture. As illustrated in our framework, the input sequence is first transformed by a Linear Tokenization Layer and then processed through multiple Mamba Encoder blocks, each equipped with an Enhanced Mamba Layer that employs Causal Convolution, SiLU activation, and a Low-Rank Neural ODE enhancement to efficiently capture temporal dynamics. This low-rank formulation reduces computational overhead while maintaining expressive power. Furthermore, a segmented selective scanning mechanism, inspired by pseudo-ODE dynamics, adaptively focuses on salient subsequences to improve scalability and long-range sequence modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODE surpasses existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight.

While conditional computation enables substantial gains in computational efficiency, it remains unclear whether the interaction between sparse routing and temperature-based sampling compromises output stability relative to dense architectures. This work investigates whether conditional computation in MoE models amplifies decoding-induced randomness, leading to reduced reliability as temperature increases. We evaluate three representative models: OLMoE-7B (sparse base), Mixtral-8x7B (sparse instruction-tuned), and Qwen2.5-3B (dense instruction-tuned) on deterministic arithmetic reasoning tasks with objectively verifiable answers. Experiments span four decoding configurations, ranging from greedy decoding to T=1.0. Our evaluation encompasses accuracy, format compliance, output consistency across repeated generations, and confidence metrics, totaling 9,360 model generations. Results demonstrate that the sparse instruction-tuned model exhibits stability comparable to the dense instruction-tuned model across all decoding temperatures, while the sparse base model shows systematic degradation as temperature increases. These findings indicate that instruction tuning, rather than architectural sparsity, is the primary determinant of robustness to decoding randomness on deterministic tasks. We discuss the implications of these results for deploying sparse language models in reliability-critical applications, highlighting scenarios in which sparse architectures can be safely adopted without sacrificing output stability."}

Our simulator, which we call SarSim0 (SARIMA Simulator for Zero-Shot Forecasting), is based off of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model as its core data source. Due to instability in the autoregressive component, naive SARIMA simulation often leads to unusable paths. Instead, we follow a three-step procedure: (1) we sample well-behaved trajectories from its characteristic polynomial stability region; (2) we introduce a superposition scheme that combines multiple paths into rich multi-seasonality traces; and (3) we add rate-based heavy-tailed noise models to capture burstiness and intermittency alongside seasonalities and trends. SarSim0 is orders of magnitude faster than kernel-based generators, and it enables training on circa 1B unique purely simulated series, generated on the fly; after which well-established neural network backbones exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing strong statistical forecasters and recent foundation baselines, while operating under strict zero-shot protocol.

While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance.

This is critical for assessing the service life of civil infrastructure subjected to aggressive environments. The adopted methodology relies on several simple and complex standalone machine learning (ML) algorithms, with the primary objective of establishing confidence in the unbiased prediction of the underlying hidden correlations. The simple algorithms include linear regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The complex algorithms entail support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and two families of artificial neural networks, including a feedforward network (multilayer perceptron, MLP) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). The MLP architecture cannot explicitly handle sequential data, a limitation addressed by the GRU. A comprehensive dataset is considered. The performance of ML algorithms is evaluated, with KRR, GPR, and MLP exhibiting high accuracy. Given the diversity of the adopted concrete mixture proportions, the GRU was unable to accurately reproduce the response in the test set. Further analyses elucidate the contributions of mixture compositions to the temporal evolution of chloride. The results obtained from the GPR model unravel latent correlations through clear and explainable trends. The MLP, SVR, and KRR also provide acceptable estimates of the overall trends. The majority of mixture components exhibit an inverse relation with chloride content, while a few components demonstrate a direct correlation.

Existing explanations largely attribute this phenomenon to optimization instability or vanishing gradients, yet such accounts fail to explain why collapse persists even under modern normalization and initialization schemes. In this paper, we argue that the collapse of deep Transformers is fundamentally a geometric problem. Standard residual updates implicitly assume that feature accumulation is always beneficial, but offer no mechanism to constrain update directions or to erase outdated information. As depth increases, this leads to systematic drift off the semantic manifold and monotonic feature accumulation, causing representational degeneracy. We propose a unified geometric framework that addresses these failures through two orthogonal principles. First, manifold-constrained hyper-connections restrict residual updates to valid local tangent directions, preventing uncontrolled manifold drift. Second, deep delta learning introduces data-dependent, non-monotonic updates that enable reflection and erasure of redundant features rather than their unconditional accumulation. Together, these mechanisms decouple the direction and sign of feature updates, yielding a stable geometric evolution across depth. We term the resulting architecture the Manifold-Geometric Transformer (MGT). Our analysis predicts that enforcing geometric validity while allowing dynamic erasure is essential for avoiding rank collapse in ultra-deep networks. We outline an evaluation protocol for Transformers exceeding 100 layers to test the hypothesis that geometry, rather than depth itself, is the key limiting factor in deep representation learning."}

In this work, we build on classical Wiener chaos expansions (WCE) to design neural operator (NO) architectures for SPDEs and SDEs: we project the driving noise paths onto orthonormal Wick Hermite features and parameterize the resulting deterministic chaos coefficients with neural operators, so that full solution trajectories can be reconstructed from noise in a single forward pass. On the theoretical side, we investigate the classical WCE results for the class of multi-dimensional SDEs and semilinear SPDEs considered here by explicitly writing down the associated coupled ODE/PDE systems for their chaos coefficients, which makes the separation between stochastic forcing and deterministic dynamics fully explicit and directly motivates our model designs.

We apply the framework on an unsupervised task, channel state information (CSI) compression, using autoencoders. Using metrics based on UMAP embeddings, combined with Wasserstein and Euclidean distances, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.85 between dataset distances and train-on-one/test-on-another task performance. We also apply the framework to a supervised beam prediction in the downlink using convolutional neural networks.

However, there is still no satisfactory theory that describes how coarse-grained quantities, such as blockwise intensity or class proportions after partitioning an image into spatial blocks, are preserved and evolve along the reverse diffusion dynamics. In previous work, the author introduced an information-theoretic Lyapunov function V for non-ergodic Markov processes on a state space partitioned into blocks, defined as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the set of stationary distributions reachable from a given initial condition, and showed that a leak-tolerant potential V-delta with a prescribed tolerance for block masses admits a closed-form expression as a scaling-and-clipping operation on block masses.\n  In this paper, I transplant this framework to the reverse diffusion process in generative models and propose a reverse diffusion scheme that is projected by the potential V-delta (referred to as the V-delta projected reverse diffusion). I extend the monotonicity of V to time-inhomogeneous block-preserving Markov kernels and show that, under small leakage and the V-delta projection, V-delta acts as an approximate Lyapunov function. Furthermore, using a toy model consisting of block-constant images and a simplified reverse kernel, I numerically demonstrate that the proposed method keeps the block-mass error and the leak-tolerant potential within the prescribed tolerance, while achieving pixel-wise accuracy and visual quality comparable to the non-projected dynamics. This study reinterprets generative sampling as a decrease of an information potential from noise to data, and provides a design principle for reverse diffusion processes with explicit control of coarse-grained quantities."}

This paper proposes the integration of low-power edge devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) into aquaculture systems to enable real-time automated monitoring and control, such as collecting data and triggering alarms, and reducing labor requirements. The system provides real-time data on the required parameters such as pH levels, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia levels to control water quality, nutrient levels, and environmental conditions enabling better maintenance, efficient resource utilization, and optimal management of the enclosed aquaculture space. The system enables alerts in case of anomaly detection. The data collected by the sensors over time can serve for important decision-making regarding optimizing water treatment processes, feed distribution, feed pattern analysis and improve feed efficiency, reducing operational costs. This research explores the feasibility of developing TinyML-based solutions for aquaculture monitoring, considering factors such as sensor selection, algorithm design, hardware constraints, and ethical considerations.

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits (LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a \\emph{refined analysis framework}, which simplifies the derivation and, importantly, produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB algorithm with an $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{5/4} c_μ^{-3/4} d^{3/4} P_T^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret, improving the $\\tilde{O}(k_μ^{2} c_μ^{-1}d^{9/10} P_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ bound in prior work, where $k_μ$ and $c_μ$ characterize the reward model's nonlinearity, $P_T$ measures the non-stationarity, $d$ and $T$ denote the dimension and time horizon. Moreover, we extend our framework to non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with function approximation, focusing on Linear Mixture MDP and Multinomial Logit (MNL) Mixture MDP. For both classes, we propose algorithms based on the weighted strategy and establish dynamic regret guarantees using our analysis framework."}

These streams obey smooth, time-parameterized symmetries, which combine through a precisely structured algebra; yet most neural network world models ignore this structure and instead repeatedly re-learn the same transformations from data. In this work, we introduce 'Flow Equivariant World Models', a framework in which both self-motion and external object motion are unified as one-parameter Lie group 'flows'. We leverage this unification to implement group equivariance with respect to these transformations, thereby providing a stable latent world representation over hundreds of timesteps. On both 2D and 3D partially observed video world modeling benchmarks, we demonstrate that Flow Equivariant World Models significantly outperform comparable state-of-the-art diffusion-based and memory-augmented world modeling architectures -- particularly when there are predictable world dynamics outside the agent's current field of view. We show that flow equivariance is particularly beneficial for long rollouts, generalizing far beyond the training horizon. By structuring world model representations with respect to internal and external motion, flow equivariance charts a scalable route to data efficient, symmetry-guided, embodied intelligence.

Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms."}

CDT employs directional cross-attention mechanisms - DNA-to-RNA attention models transcriptional regulation, while RNA-to-Protein attention models translational relationships - producing a unified Virtual Cell Embedding that integrates all three modalities. We validate CDT v1 - a proof-of-concept implementation using fixed (non-cell-specific) RNA and protein embeddings - on CRISPRi enhancer perturbation data from K562 cells, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.503, representing 63% of the theoretical ceiling set by cross-experiment variability (r = 0.797). Attention and gradient analyses provide complementary interpretive windows: in detailed case studies, these approaches highlight largely distinct genomic regions, with gradient analysis identifying a CTCF binding site that Hi-C data showed as physically contacting both enhancer and target gene.

Most of these tools rely on simple additive scoring functions and are based on data from patients with advanced-stage CKD. Consequently, they fail to capture complex interactions among risk factors and are limited in predicting early-stage CKD. Our objective was to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning (ML) framework for community-based early-stage CKD screening for low-resource settings, tailored to the Bangladeshi and South Asian population context. We used a community-based dataset from Bangladesh, the first such CKD dataset in South and South Asia, and evaluated twelve ML classifiers across multiple feature domains. Ten complementary feature selection techniques were applied to identify robust, generalizable predictors. The final models were assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. External validation was conducted on three independent datasets from India, the UAE, and Bangladesh. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to provide model explainability. An ML model trained on an RFECV-selected feature subset achieved a balanced accuracy of 90.40%, whereas minimal non-pathology-test features demonstrated excellent predictive capability with a balanced accuracy of 89.23%, often outperforming larger or full feature sets.

A crucial component of GNNs is the pooling procedure, in which the node features calculated by the model are combined to form an informative final descriptor to be used for the downstream task. However, previous graph pooling schemes rely on the last GNN layer features as an input to the pooling or classifier layers, potentially under-utilizing important activations of previous layers produced during the forward pass of the model, which we regard as historical graph activations. This gap is particularly pronounced in cases where a node's representation can shift significantly over the course of many graph neural layers, and worsened by graph-specific challenges such as over-smoothing in deep architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce HISTOGRAPH, a novel two-stage attention-based final aggregation layer that first applies a unified layer-wise attention over intermediate activations, followed by node-wise attention. By modeling the evolution of node representations across layers, our HISTOGRAPH leverages both the activation history of nodes and the graph structure to refine features used for final prediction. Empirical results on multiple graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that HISTOGRAPH offers strong performance that consistently improves traditional techniques, with particularly strong robustness in deep GNNs."}

According to Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations (1953), family resemblance holds that members of a concept or category are connected by overlapping similarities rather than a single defining property. Consequently, a family of entities forms a chain of items sharing overlapping traits. This philosophical idea naturally lends itself to a graph-based approach in machine learning. Accordingly, we propose the Wittgenstein's Family Resemblance (WFR) clustering algorithm and its kernel variant, kernel WFR. This algorithm computes resemblance scores between neighboring data instances, and after thresholding these scores, a resemblance graph is constructed. The connected components of this graph define the resulting clusters. Simulations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WFR is an effective nonlinear clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters or assumptions about their shapes."}

Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.

Given modern seismic acquisition systems, the data (as input for FWI) required for an industrial-strength case is in the teraflop level of storage, therefore solving complex subsurface cases or exploring multiple scenarios with FWI become prohibitive. The proposed method utilizes a deep neural network with a binarized sensing layer that learns by compressed learning a succinct but consequential seismic acquisition layout from a large corpus of subsurface models. Thus, given a large seismic data set to invert, the trained network selects a smaller subset of the data, then by using representation learning, an autoencoder computes latent representations of the data, followed by K-means clustering of the latent representations to further select the most relevant data for FWI. Effectively, this approach can be seen as a hierarchical selection. The proposed approach consistently outperforms random data sampling, even when utilizing only 10% of the data for 2D FWI, these results pave the way to accelerating FWI in large scale 3D inversion."}

However, despite the empirical evidence of its usefulness, we still do not truly understand how ICL works. In this paper, we compare the behavior of in-context learning with supervised classifiers trained on ICL demonstrations to investigate three research questions: (1) Do LLMs with ICL behave similarly to classifiers trained on the same examples? (2) If so, which classifiers are closer, those based on gradient descent (GD) or those based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN)? (3) When they do not behave similarly, what conditions are associated with differences in behavior? Using text classification as a use case, with six datasets and three LLMs, we observe that LLMs behave similarly to these classifiers when the relevance of demonstrations is high. On average, ICL is closer to kNN than logistic regression, giving empirical evidence that the attention mechanism behaves more similarly to kNN than GD. However, when demonstration relevance is low, LLMs perform better than these classifiers, likely because LLMs can back off to their parametric memory, a luxury these classifiers do not have."}

Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \\le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\\mathscr{B}^{\\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s>0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity.

We then define a family $\\mathscr{B}^{s,\\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved.

A central requirement of $μ$P is the satisfaction of certain spectral conditions on weight matrices, which ensure consistent feature learning and optimization behavior as model width grows. While these conditions are well understood in theory, guaranteeing their validity in practical training for matrix-based optimizers such as Muon is still under studied. Existing works that study Muon under $μ$P exhibit important limitations: they either do not ensure that the spectral conditions hold throughout the entire training horizon, or require repeated spectral normalization (or Newton-Schulz iterations) applied to both weights and updates, leading to significant computational overhead and reduced practicality. In this work, we show how to reliably guarantee the spectral conditions required by $μ$P for Muon during the entire training process. Our key insight is that for moderately large models, maintaining spectral control at the level of optimizer updates alone is sufficient to preserve $μ$P-compatible scaling, eliminating the need for explicit spectral normalization of the weights. Based on this principle, we develop a variant of Muon, namely Muon++, that satisfies spectral condition throughout the training process. Our results bridge the gap between the theoretical promises of $μ$P and the practical deployment of matrix-based optimizers in long-horizon training. We also take the first step towards an adaptive spectral condition by incorporating data-dependent effects, making it better suited for long-horizon LLM training."}

Uniquely, GM-MLG pioneers transforming ADR prediction from multi-label classification into Transformer Decoder-based multi-label generation. By treating ADR labels as discrete token sequences, it employs positional embeddings to explicitly capture dependencies and co-occurrence relationships within large-scale label spaces, generating predictions via autoregressive decoding to dynamically expand the prediction space. Experiments demonstrate GM-MLG achieves up to 38% improvement and an average gain of 20%, expanding the prediction space from 200 to over 10,000 types. Furthermore, it elucidates non-linear structure-activity relationships between ADRs and motifs via retrosynthetic motif analysis, providing interpretable and innovative support for systematic risk reduction in drug safety."}

When working on the model induction, selecting the right architecture for a given dataset often relies on repetitive trial-and-error procedures. This procedure is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and difficult to automate. While previous work has explored performance prediction using partial training or complex simulations, these methods often require significant computational overhead or lack generalizability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: a lightweight, two-stage framework that can estimate model performance before training given the understanding of the dataset and the focused deep model structures. The first stage predicts a baseline based on the analysis of some measurable properties of the dataset, while the second stage adjusts the estimation with additional information on the model's architectural and hyperparameter details. The setup allows the framework to generalize across datasets and model types. Moreover, we find that some of the underlying features used for prediction - such as dataset variance - can offer practical guidance for model selection, and can serve as early indicators of data quality. As a result, the framework can be used not only to forecast model performance, but also to guide architecture choices, inform necessary preprocessing procedures, and detect potentially problematic datasets before training begins."}

This design not only avoids the risk of error amplification in branch power calculation but also guides the model to learn the physical relationships of phase angle differences. In addition, the loss function incorporates extra terms that encourage the model to capture the physical patterns of angle differences and power transmission, further improving consistency between predictions and physical laws.

These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds.

This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter.

However, the estimation error of diffusion models suffers from the curse of dimensionality $n^{-1/D}$ with the data dimension $D$. Since images are usually a union of low-dimensional manifolds, current works model the data as a union of linear subspaces with Gaussian latent and achieve a $1/\\sqrt{n}$ bound. Though this modeling reflects the multi-manifold property, the Gaussian latent can not capture the multi-modal property of the latent manifold. To bridge this gap, we propose the mixture subspace of low-rank mixture of Gaussian (MoLR-MoG) modeling, which models the target data as a union of $K$ linear subspaces, and each subspace admits a mixture of Gaussian latent ($n_k$ modals with dimension $d_k$). With this modeling, the corresponding score function naturally has a mixture of expert (MoE) structure, captures the multi-modal information, and contains nonlinear property. We first conduct real-world experiments to show that the generation results of MoE-latent MoG NN are much better than MoE-latent Gaussian score. Furthermore, MoE-latent MoG NN achieves a comparable performance with MoE-latent Unet with $10 \\times$ parameters. These results indicate that the MoLR-MoG modeling is reasonable and suitable for real-world data. After that, based on such MoE-latent MoG score, we provide a $R^4\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_k}\\sqrt{Σ_{k=1}^Kn_kd_k}/\\sqrt{n}$ estimation error, which escapes the curse of dimensionality by using data structure.

While KD has shown strong empirical success in numerous applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain only partially understood. In this work, we adopt a Bayesian perspective on KD to rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of students trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We study two regimes: $(i)$ when the teacher provides the exact Bayes Class Probabilities (BCPs); and $(ii)$ supervision with noisy approximations of the BCPs. Our analysis shows that learning from BCPs yields variance reduction and removes neighborhood terms in the convergence bounds compared to one-hot supervision. We further characterize how the level of noise affects generalization and accuracy. Motivated by these insights, we advocate the use of Bayesian deep learning models, which typically provide improved estimates of the BCPs, as teachers in KD. Consistent with our analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that students distilled from Bayesian teachers not only achieve higher accuracies (up to +4.27%), but also exhibit more stable convergence (up to 30% less noise), compared to students distilled from deterministic teachers."}

With a deliberately designed update, OLDSGD preserves the same average update as Local SGD while avoiding communication-induced stalls. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for smooth non-convex objectives, showing that OLDSGD retains the same iteration complexity as standard Local Decentralized SGD while improving per-iteration runtime. Empirical results demonstrate OLDSGD's consistent improvements in wall-clock time convergence under different levels of communication delays.

In this work, we reframe this problem and introduce the Hierarchical Graph ODE (HiGO), a novel framework designed to learn the multi-scale, continuous-time dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we represent the Earth system as a multi-level graph hierarchy and propose an adaptive filtering message passing mechanism for both intra- and inter-level information flow, enabling more effective feature extraction and fusion. Furthermore, we incorporate GNN-parameterized Neural ODE modules at multiple levels to explicitly learn the continuous dynamics inherent to each scale. Through extensive experiments on the SeasFire Cube dataset, we demonstrate that HiGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-range wildfire forecasting. Moreover, its continuous-time predictions exhibit strong observational consistency, highlighting its potential for real-world applications."}

These embeddings summarize patterns in vegetation, land surface properties, and long-term environmental dynamics. We find that models using them achieve higher accuracy when predicting flows in basins not used for training, suggesting that they capture key physical differences more effectively than traditional attributes. We further investigate how selecting appropriate donor basins influences prediction in ungauged regions. Similarity based on the embeddings helps identify basins with comparable environmental and hydrological behavior, improving performance, whereas adding many dissimilar basins can reduce accuracy.

A hardware setup comprising voltage and current sensors, Arduino Mega and ESP8266 was developed to capture aggregate and individual load data, which was stored and processed on cloud platforms.

However, existing methods typically assume full client availability, which is rarely practical. In real-world FL systems, clients often participate in a cyclic manner: joining training according to a fixed, repeating schedule. This setting poses unique optimization challenges for the non-decomposable AUC objective. This paper addresses these challenges by developing and analyzing communication-efficient algorithms for federated AUC maximization under cyclic client participation. We investigate two key settings: First, we study AUC maximization with a squared surrogate loss, which reformulates the problem as a nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. By leveraging the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we establish a state-of-the-art communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Second, we consider general pairwise AUC losses. We establish a communication complexity of $O(1/ε^3)$ and an iteration complexity of $O(1/ε^4)$. Further, under the PL condition, these bounds improve to communication complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε^{1/2})$ and iteration complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(1/ε)$. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks in image classification, medical imaging, and fraud detection demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods."}

Elections have been the canonical way by which modern democracy has operated since the 17th century.

However, a desirable universal voting rule that satisfies all hypothetical scenarios is still a challenging topic, and the design of these systems is at the forefront of mechanism design research. Automated mechanism design is a promising approach, and recent works have demonstrated that set-invariant architectures are uniquely suited to modelling electoral systems. However, various concerns prevent the direct application to real-world settings, such as robustness to strategic voting. In this paper, we generalise the expressive capability of learned voting rules, and combine improvements in neural network architecture with adversarial training to improve the resilience of voting rules while maximizing social welfare. We evaluate the effectiveness of our methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our method resolves critical limitations of prior work regarding learning voting rules by representing elections using bipartite graphs, and learning such voting rules using graph neural networks.

To mitigate this, prior work has explored selecting a model from a set of candidates. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive as the number of candidate models increases. Moreover, poorly performing models in the set may also hinder the effectiveness. To tackle this challenge, this work develops a novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that reduces computational complexity and improves prediction efficiency.

To address these problems, we propose a suite of digital twin-integrated federated learning (DTFL) methods that enhance global model performance while preserving data privacy and communication efficiency. Specifically, we present five novel approaches: Digital Twin-Based Meta-Learning (DTML), Federated Parameter Fusion (FPF), Layer-wise Parameter Exchange (LPE), Cyclic Weight Adaptation (CWA), and Digital Twin Knowledge Distillation (DTKD). Each method introduces a unique mechanism to combine synthetic and real-world knowledge, balancing generalization with communication overhead. We conduct an extensive experiment using a publicly available cyber-physical anomaly detection dataset. For a target accuracy of 80%, CWA reaches the target in 33 rounds, FPF in 41 rounds, LPE in 48 rounds, and DTML in 87 rounds, whereas the standard FedAvg baseline and DTKD do not reach the target within 100 rounds. These results highlight substantial communication-efficiency gains (up to 62% fewer rounds than DTML and 31% fewer than LPE) and demonstrate that integrating DT knowledge into FL accelerates convergence to operationally meaningful accuracy thresholds for IIoT anomaly detection."}

In this paper, we introduce EPIC, a hyperparameter-free decoding approach that incorporates the entropy of future trajectories into LM decoding. EPIC explicitly regulates the amount of uncertainty expressed at every step of generation, aligning the sampling distribution's entropy to the aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Through Entropy-Aware Lazy Gumbel-Max sampling, EPIC manages to be exact, while also being efficient, requiring only a sublinear number of entropy evaluations per step. Unlike current baselines, EPIC yields sampling distributions that are empirically well-aligned with the entropy of the underlying data distribution. Across creative writing and summarization tasks, EPIC consistently improves LM-as-judge preference win-rates over widely used decoding strategies. These preference gains are complemented by automatic metrics, showing that EPIC produces more diverse generations and more faithful summaries.

Merrill & Sabharwal (2024) show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length $n$) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open.

We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms."}

Machine unlearning has emerged as a promising direction for selectively forgetting data points. However, existing unlearning techniques typically apply a uniform forgetting strategy that neither accounts for the varying privacy risks posed by different PII attributes nor reflects associated business risks. In this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning approach that prioritizes forgetting based on the risk of individual or combined PII attributes. To this end, we introduce the PII risk index (PRI), a composite metric that incorporates multiple dimensions of risk factors: identifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy. The PRI enables a nuanced evaluation of privacy risks associated with PII exposures and can be tailored to align with organizational privacy policies. To support realistic assessment, we systematically construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that simulates realistic exposure scenarios. UnPII seamlessly integrates with established unlearning algorithms, such as Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct Preference Optimization, without modifying their underlying principles. Our experimental results demonstrate that UnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up to 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively, while incurring a modest fine-tuning overhead of 27.5% on average during unlearning."}

While providing a fully decentralized approach, the designed framework retains the core federated learning structure where each server is associated with a disjoint set of clients with server-client communication capabilities. We propose a novel DFL (Distributed Federated Learning) algorithm which uses alternating periods of local training on the client data followed by global training among servers.

As a primary countermeasure, adversarial training improves policy robustness by training the AD agent in the presence of an adversary that deliberately introduces perturbations. Existing approaches typically model the interaction as a zero-sum game with continuous attacks. However, such designs overlook the inherent asymmetry between the agent and the adversary and then fail to reflect the sparsity of safety-critical risks, rendering the achieved robustness inadequate for practical AD scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce criticality-aware robust RL (CARRL), a novel adversarial training approach for handling sparse, safety-critical risks in autonomous driving. CARRL consists of two interacting components: a risk exposure adversary (REA) and a risk-targeted robust agent (RTRA). We model the interaction between the REA and RTRA as a general-sum game, allowing the REA to focus on exposing safety-critical failures (e.g., collisions) while the RTRA learns to balance safety with driving efficiency. The REA employs a decoupled optimization mechanism to better identify and exploit sparse safety-critical moments under a constrained budget. However, such focused attacks inevitably result in a scarcity of adversarial data. The RTRA copes with this scarcity by jointly leveraging benign and adversarial experiences via a dual replay buffer and enforces policy consistency under perturbations to stabilize behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the collision rate by at least 22.66\\% across all cases compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

In continuous control tasks, even small parameter shifts can produce unstable gaits, complicating both algorithm comparison and real-world transfer. Previous work has shown that such instability arises when policy updates traverse noisy neighborhoods and that the spread of post-update return distribution $R(θ)$, obtained by repeatedly sampling minibatches, updating $θ$, and measuring final returns, is a useful indicator of this noise. Although explicitly constraining the policy to maintain a narrow $R(θ)$ can improve stability, directly estimating $R(θ)$ is computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. We propose an alternative that takes advantage of environmental stochasticity to mitigate update-induced variability. Specifically, we model state-action return distribution through a distributional critic and then bias the advantage function of PPO using higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) of this distribution. By penalizing extreme tail behaviors, our method discourages policies from entering parameter regimes prone to instability. We hypothesize that in environments where post-update critic values align poorly with post-update returns, standard PPO struggles to produce a narrow $R(θ)$. In such cases, our moment-based correction narrows $R(θ)$, improving stability by up to 75% in Walker2D, while preserving comparable evaluation returns."}

We introduce RealPDEBench, the first benchmark for scientific ML that integrates real-world measurements with paired numerical simulations. RealPDEBench consists of five datasets, three tasks, eight metrics, and ten baselines.

These attacks aim to implant a stealthy trigger into the global model, causing it to mislead on inputs that possess a specific trigger while functioning normally on benign data. Although pre-aggregation detection is a main defense direction, existing state-of-the-art defenses often rely on fixed defense parameters. This reliance makes them vulnerable to single-point-of-failure risks, rendering them less effective against sophisticated attackers. To address these limitations, we propose FAROS, an enhanced FL framework that incorporates Adaptive Differential Scaling (ADS) and Robust Core-set Computing (RCC). The ADS mechanism adjusts the defense's sensitivity dynamically, based on the dispersion of uploaded gradients by clients in each round. This allows it to counter attackers who strategically shift between stealthiness and effectiveness. Furthermore, the RCC effectively mitigates the risk of single-point failure by computing the centroid of a core set comprising clients with the highest confidence. We conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, models, and attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms current defenses in both attack success rate and main task accuracy."}

To tackle this limitation, we propose a personalized federated learning method based on cosine sparsification parameter packing and dual-weighted aggregation (FedCSPACK), which effectively leverages the limited client resources and reduces the impact of data heterogeneity on model performance. In FedCSPACK, the client packages model parameters and selects the most contributing parameter packages for sharing based on cosine similarity, effectively reducing bandwidth requirements. The client then generates a mask matrix anchored to the shared parameter package to improve the alignment and aggregation efficiency of sparse updates on the server. Furthermore, directional and distribution distance weights are embedded in the mask to implement a weighted-guided aggregation mechanism, enhancing the robustness and generalization performance of the global model. Extensive experiments across four datasets using ten state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that FedCSPACK effectively improves communication and computational efficiency while maintaining high model accuracy."}

Remarkably, this recovery is effective regardless of the number of harmful examples used in fine-tuning or the size of the underlying model, and convergence is achieved within just a few epochs.

To address this, we introduce a novel concept called quantile distortion, which enables non-uniform pessimism by adjusting the degree of conservatism based on the availability of supporting data.

This evolutionary process adapts to the model's ability throughout training, optimising problems for learnability.

This motivates an instance-level audit problem: for a fine-tuned model and a training prompt-response pair, can we infer whether the model was trained on the original prompt or its LLM-refined version within a mixed corpus? This matters for dataset governance and dispute resolution when training data are contested. However, it is non-trivial in practice: refined and raw instances are interleaved in the training corpus with unknown, source-dependent mixture ratios, making it harder to develop provenance methods that generalize across models and training setups. In this paper, we formalize this audit task as Refinement Provenance Inference (RPI) and show that prompt refinement yields stable, detectable shifts in teacher-forced token distributions, even when semantic differences are not obvious. Building on this phenomenon, we propose RePro, a logit-based provenance framework that fuses teacher-forced likelihood features with logit-ranking signals. During training, RePro learns a transferable representation via shadow fine-tuning, and uses a lightweight linear head to infer provenance on unseen victims without training-data access. Empirically, RePro consistently attains strong performance and transfers well across refiners, suggesting that it exploits refiner-agnostic distribution shifts rather than rewrite-style artifacts."}

In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment."}

The use of group-level rewards successfully aligns the model with the targeted reward. However, it faces challenges including low efficiency, dependency on stochastic samplers, and reward hacking. The problem is that rectified flow models are fundamentally different from LLMs: 1) For efficiency, online image sampling takes much more time and dominates the time of training. 2) For stochasticity, rectified flow is deterministic once the initial noise is fixed. Aiming at these problems and inspired by the effects of group-level rewards from LLMs, we design Group-level Direct Reward Optimization (GDRO). GDRO is a new post-training paradigm for group-level reward alignment that combines the characteristics of rectified flow models. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we point out that GDRO supports full offline training that saves the large time cost for image rollout sampling. Also, it is diffusion-sampler-independent, which eliminates the need for the ODE-to-SDE approximation to obtain stochasticity. We also empirically study the reward hacking trap that may mislead the evaluation, and involve this factor in the evaluation using a corrected score that not only considers the original evaluation reward but also the trend of reward hacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDRO effectively and efficiently improves the reward score of the diffusion model through group-wise offline optimization across the OCR and GenEval tasks, while demonstrating strong stability and robustness in mitigating reward hacking."}

Notably, we probe the persistent Spring Predictability Barrier (SPB), finding that despite expanded sensitivity during spring, predictive performance declines-likely due to suboptimal variable selection. These results suggest that incorporating additional ocean-atmosphere variables may help transcend SPB limitations and advance long-range ENSO prediction."}

In this work, we identify a critical spectral degradation phenomenon inherent to these constraints, termed the Homogeneity Trap. We demonstrate that the maximum-entropy bias, typical of Sinkhorn-based projections, drives the mixing operator towards the uniform barycenter, thereby suppressing the subdominant singular value σ_2 and filtering out high-frequency feature components. We derive a spectral bound linking σ_2 to the network's effective depth, showing that high-entropy constraints restrict feature transformation to a shallow effective receptive field. Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that Layer Normalization fails to mitigate this collapse in noise-dominated regimes; specifically, when spectral filtering degrades the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) below a critical threshold, geometric structure is irreversibly lost to noise-induced orthogonal collapse. Our findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between entropic stability and spectral expressivity in DSM-constrained networks."}

The traditional data subsampling method works as a static, task independent preprocessing step which usually discards information that is critical to downstream prediction. In this paper, we introduces the antagonistic soft selection subsampling (ASSS) framework as is a novel paradigm that reconstructs data reduction into a differentiable end-to-end learning problem. ASSS uses the adversarial game between selector network and task network, and selector network learning assigns continuous importance weights to samples. This direct optimization implemented by Gumbel-Softmax relaxation allows the selector to identify and retain samples with the maximum amount of information for a specific task target under the guidance of the loss function that balances the fidelity and sparsity of the prediction. Theoretical analysis links this framework with the information bottleneck principle. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale real world datasets show that ASSS has always been better than heuristic subsampling baselines such as clustering and nearest neighbor thinning in maintaining model performance. It is worth noting that ASSS can not only match, but also sometimes exceed the training performance of the entire dataset, showcasing the effect of intelligent denoising. This work establishes task aware data subsampling as a learnable component, providing a principled solution for effective large-scale data learning."}

To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families."}

Traditional predictive methods often struggle to balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency when capturing complex spatial conformations. To address this challenge, we propose an Edge-aware Graph Attention Network (Edge-aware GAT) model for the fine-grained prediction of binding sites across various biomolecules, including proteins, DNA/RNA, ions, ligands, and lipids. Our method constructs atom-level graphs and integrates multidimensional structural features, including geometric descriptors, DSSP-derived secondary structure, and relative solvent accessibility (RSA), to generate spatially aware embedding vectors. By incorporating interatomic distances and directional vectors as edge features within the attention mechanism, the model significantly enhances its representation capacity. On benchmark datasets, our model achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.93 for protein-protein binding site prediction, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The use of directional tensor propagation and residue-level attention pooling further improves both binding site localization and the capture of local structural details. Visualizations using PyMOL confirm the model's practical utility and interpretability. To facilitate community access and application, we have deployed a publicly accessible web server at http://119.45.201.89:5000/.

In sharp contrast, on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) effectively preserves general capabilities. We investigate this discrepancy and identify a fundamental distributional gap: while RL aligns with the model's internal belief, SFT forces the model to fit external supervision. This mismatch often manifests as \"Confident Conflicts\" tokens characterized by low probability but low entropy. In these instances, the model is highly confident in its own prediction but is forced to learn a divergent ground truth, triggering destructive gradient updates. To address this, we propose Entropy-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (EAFT). Unlike methods relying solely on prediction probability, EAFT utilizes token-level entropy as a gating mechanism to distinguish between epistemic uncertainty and knowledge conflict. This allows the model to learn from uncertain samples while suppressing gradients on conflicting data. Extensive experiments on Qwen and GLM series (ranging from 4B to 32B parameters) across mathematical, medical, and agentic domains confirm our hypothesis. EAFT consistently matches the downstream performance of standard SFT while significantly mitigating the degradation of general capabilities."}

These added points are constrained to be monotone corruptions, in that they get labeled according to the ground-truth target function. Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that in this setting, all known optimal learning algorithms for binary classification can be made to achieve suboptimal expected error on a new independent test point drawn from the same distribution as the clean dataset. On the other hand, we show that uniform convergence-based algorithms do not degrade in their guarantees.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines."}

To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training paradigm for building powerful virtual agents."}

Specifically, we introduce three innovations for quantized equivariant transformers: (1) a magnitude-direction decoupled quantization scheme that separately quantizes the norm and orientation of equivariant (vector) features, (2) a branch-separated quantization-aware training strategy that treats invariant and equivariant feature channels differently in an attention-based $SO(3)$-GNN, and (3) a robustness-enhancing attention normalization mechanism that stabilizes low-precision attention computations.

We also conduct ablation studies to quantify the contribution of each component to maintain accuracy and equivariance under quantization, using the Local error of equivariance (LEE) metric.

Existing approaches are fundamentally limited: replay-based methods are impractical and privacy-violating, while strict orthogonality-based methods collapse under scale: each new task is projected onto an orthogonal complement, progressively reducing the residual degrees of freedom and eliminating forward transfer by forbidding overlap in shared representations. In this work, we introduce ELLA, a training framework built on the principle of selective subspace de-correlation. Rather than forbidding all overlap, ELLA explicitly characterizes the structure of past updates and penalizes alignments along their high-energy, task-specific directions, while preserving freedom in the low-energy residual subspaces to enable transfer. Formally, this is realized via a lightweight regularizer on a single aggregated update matrix. We prove this mechanism corresponds to an anisotropic shrinkage operator that bounds interference, yielding a penalty that is both memory- and compute-constant regardless of task sequence length. ELLA requires no data replay, no architectural expansion, and negligible storage. Empirically, it achieves state-of-the-art CL performance on three popular benchmarks, with relative accuracy gains of up to $9.6\\%$ and a $35\\times$ smaller memory footprint. Further, ELLA scales robustly across architectures and actively enhances the model's zero-shot generalization performance on unseen tasks, establishing a principled and scalable solution for constructive lifelong LLM adaptation."}

These specialized accelerators are not only prohibitively expensive and energy-intensive but also suffer from significant supply scarcity, limiting the ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment on edge devices. The core of this inefficiency stems from the standard artificial perceptron's dependence on intensive matrix multiplications. However, biological nervous systems achieve unparalleled efficiency without such arithmetic intensity; synaptic signal transmission is regulated by physical ion channel limits and chemical neurotransmitter levels rather than a process that can be analogous to arithmetic multiplication. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we propose Neuro-Channel Networks (NCN), a novel multiplication-free architecture designed to decouple AI from expensive hardware dependencies. In our model, weights are replaced with Channel Widths that physically limit the signal magnitude, while a secondary parameter acts as a Neurotransmitter to regulate Signal Transmission based on sign logic. The forward pass relies exclusively on addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations (minimum, sign), eliminating floating-point multiplication entirely. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that NCNs can solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR and the Majority function with 100% accuracy using standard backpropagation, proving their capability to form complex decision boundaries without multiplicative weights. This architecture offers a highly efficient alternative for next-generation neuromorphic hardware, paving the way for running complex models on commodity CPUs or ultra-low-power chips without relying on costly GPU clusters."}

To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy.

Classical approaches assume a worst-case adversarial model and ensure error correction and data recovery only when the number of honest nodes exceeds the number of adversarial ones by some margin. However, in some emerging decentralized applications, particularly in decentralized machine learning (DeML), participating nodes are rewarded for accepted contributions. This incentive structure naturally gives rise to rational adversaries who act strategically rather than behaving in purely malicious ways.\n  In this paper, we first motivate the need for coding in the presence of rational adversaries, particularly in the context of outsourced computation in decentralized systems. We contrast this need with existing approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce the game of coding, a novel game-theoretic framework that extends coding theory to trust-minimized settings where honest nodes are not in the majority. Focusing on repetition coding, we highlight two key features of this framework: (1) the ability to achieve a non-zero probability of data recovery even when adversarial nodes are in the majority, and (2) Sybil resistance, i.e., the equilibrium remains unchanged even as the number of adversarial nodes increases. Finally, we explore scenarios in which the adversary's strategy is unknown and outline several open problems for future research."}

Despite a large body of work focused on training frontier vision-language models (VLMs), approaches to their evaluation remain nascent. To guide their maturation, we propose three desiderata that evaluations should satisfy: (1) faithfulness to the modality and application, (2) discriminability between models of varying quality, and (3) efficiency in compute. Through this lens, we identify critical failure modes that violate faithfulness and discriminability, misrepresenting model capabilities: (i) multiple-choice formats reward guessing, poorly reflect downstream use cases, and saturate early as models improve; (ii) blindly solvable questions, which can be answered without images, constitute up to 70% of some evaluations; and (iii) mislabeled or ambiguous samples compromise up to 42% of examples in certain datasets. Regarding efficiency, the computational burden of evaluating frontier models has become prohibitive: by some accounts, nearly 20% of development compute is devoted to evaluation alone. Rather than discarding existing benchmarks, we curate them via transformation and filtering to maximize fidelity and discriminability. We find that converting multiple-choice questions to generative tasks reveals sharp capability drops of up to 35%. In addition, filtering blindly solvable and mislabeled samples improves discriminative power while simultaneously reducing computational cost. We release DatBench-Full, a cleaned evaluation suite of 33 datasets spanning nine VLM capabilities, and DatBench, a discriminative subset that achieves 13x average speedup (up to 50x) while closely matching the discriminative power of the original datasets.

We introduce a heterogeneous distributed training framework where some participants host full replicas on high-bandwidth interconnects, while resource-limited participants are grouped to jointly instantiate a replica using pipeline parallelism with subspace-projected inter-stage communication. To make the recently introduced subspace pipeline compression compatible with SparseLoCo, we study a number of adaptations. Across large-scale language modeling experiments (178M-1B parameters) on standard pretraining corpora, we find that activation compression composes with SparseLoCo at modest cost, while selective (heterogeneous) compression consistently improves the loss-communication tradeoff relative to compressing all replicas-especially at aggressive compression ratios. These results suggest a practical path to incorporating low-bandwidth model parallelism and heterogeneous participants into LLM pre-training."}

We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation."}

This paper introduces ChronoPlastic Spiking Neural Networks (CPSNNs), a novel architectural principle that enables adaptive temporal credit assignment by dynamically modulating synaptic decay rates conditioned on the state of the network. CPSNNs maintain multiple internal temporal traces and learn a continuous time-warping function that selectively preserves task-relevant information while rapidly forgetting noise. Unlike prior approaches based on adaptive membrane constants, attention mechanisms, or external memory, CPSNNs embed temporal control directly within local synaptic dynamics, preserving linear-time complexity and neuromorphic compatibility. We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive temporal modulation is a key missing ingredient for scalable temporal learning in spiking systems."}

Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy. When integrated with FAIR data principles, this approach serves as a blueprint for the trusted autonomous battery laboratories of the future."}

To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters.

We find that inventions based on deep search, which relies on a specialized understanding of complex recombination structures, drive higher short-term impact through early adoption within specialized communities, but face diminishing returns as innovations become \"locked-in\" with limited diffusion potential. Conversely, when inventions are grounded in broad search that spans disparate domains, they encounter initial resistance but achieve wider diffusion and greater long-term impact by reaching cognitively diverse audiences. Individual inventions require both depth and breadth for stable impact. Organizations can strategically balance approaches across multiple inventions: using depth to build reliable technological infrastructure while pursuing breadth to expand applications. We advance innovation theory by demonstrating how deep and broad search strategies distinctly shape the timing and trajectory of technological impact, and how individual inventors and organizations can leverage these mechanisms to balance exploitation and exploration."}

This study leverages statistical analysis ($χ^2$ test of independence and Two Proportion Z-Test) and machine learning clustering techniques -- K-Modes and K-Prototypes -- along with t-SNE visualization and CatBoost classification to analyze socioeconomic integration and inequality. Using statistical tests, we identified the proportion of the population with healthcare insurance, quality education, and employment. With this data, we concluded that there was an association between employment and citizenship status. Moreover, we were able to determine 5 distinct population groups using Machine Learning classification. The five clusters our analysis identifies reveal that while citizenship status shows no association with workforce participation, significant disparities exist in access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Each cluster represents a distinct demographic of the population, showing that there is a primary split along the lines of educational attainment which separates Clusters 0 and 4 from Clusters 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, labor force status and nativity serve as secondary differentiators. Non-citizens are also disproportionately concentrated in precarious employment without benefits, highlighting systemic inequalities in healthcare access.

Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging computational intelligence paradigm for SAR image target recognition, enabling cross-site collaboration while preserving local data privacy. However, FL confronts critical security risks, where malicious clients can exploit SAR's multiplicative speckle noise to conceal backdoor triggers, severely challenging the robustness of the computational intelligence model. To address this challenge, we propose NADAFD, a noise-aware and dynamically adaptive federated defense framework that integrates frequency-domain, spatial-domain, and client-behavior analyses to counter SAR-specific backdoor threats. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain collaborative inversion mechanism to expose cross-client spectral inconsistencies indicative of hidden backdoor triggers. We further design a noise-aware adversarial training strategy that embeds $Γ$-distributed speckle characteristics into mask-guided adversarial sample generation to enhance robustness against both backdoor attacks and SAR speckle noise. In addition, we present a dynamic health assessment module that tracks client update behaviors across training rounds and adaptively adjusts aggregation weights to mitigate evolving malicious contributions. Experiments on MSTAR and OpenSARShip datasets demonstrate that NADAFD achieves higher accuracy on clean test samples and a lower backdoor attack success rate on triggered inputs than existing federated backdoor defenses for SAR target recognition."}

In this work, we present deep deterministic nonlinear independent component analysis (DDICA), a novel deep neural network-based framework designed to address these limitations. DDICA leverages a matrix-based entropy function to directly optimize the independence criterion via stochastic gradient descent, bypassing the need for variational approximations or adversarial schemes. This results in a streamlined training process and improved resilience to noise. We validated the effectiveness and generalizability of DDICA across a range of applications, including simulated signal mixtures, hyperspectral image unmixing, modeling of primary visual receptive fields, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis.

In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

Traditional approaches first estimate demand functions and then integrate to compute consumer surplus, but these methods can be challenging to implement in practice due to model misspecification in parametric demand forms and the large data requirements and slow convergence of flexible nonparametric or machine learning approaches. Instead, we exploit the randomness inherent in modern algorithmic pricing, arising from the need to balance exploration and exploitation, and introduce an estimator that avoids explicit estimation and numerical integration of the demand function. Each observed purchase outcome at a randomized price is an unbiased estimate of demand and by carefully reweighting purchase outcomes using novel cumulative propensity weights (CPW), we are able to reconstruct the integral. Building on this idea, we introduce a doubly robust variant named the augmented cumulative propensity weighting (ACPW) estimator that only requires one of either the demand model or the historical pricing policy distribution to be correctly specified. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the use of flexible machine learning methods for estimating consumer surplus, since it achieves fast convergence rates by incorporating an estimate of demand, even when the machine learning estimate has slower convergence rates. Neither of these estimators is a standard application of off-policy evaluation techniques as the target estimand, consumer surplus, is unobserved. To address fairness, we extend this framework to an inequality-aware surplus measure, allowing regulators and firms to quantify the profit-equity trade-off. Finally, we validate our methods through comprehensive numerical studies."}

Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data."}

Traditional federated learning approaches for IoT security suffer from two critical vulnerabilities: susceptibility to Byzantine attacks where malicious participants poison model updates, and inadequacy against future quantum computing threats that can compromise cryptographic aggregation protocols. This paper presents a novel Byzantine-robust federated learning framework integrated with post-quantum secure aggregation specifically designed for real-time threat intelligence sharing across critical IoT infrastructure. The proposed framework combines a adaptive weighted aggregation mechanism with lattice-based cryptographic protocols to simultaneously defend against model poisoning attacks and quantum adversaries. We introduce a reputation-based client selection algorithm that dynamically identifies and excludes Byzantine participants while maintaining differential privacy guarantees. The secure aggregation protocol employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and homomorphic encryption to ensure confidentiality during parameter updates. Experimental evaluation on industrial IoT intrusion detection datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves 96.8% threat detection accuracy while successfully mitigating up to 40% Byzantine attackers, with only 18% computational overhead compared to non-secure federated approaches.

In contrast with classical boosting  Freund and Schapire (1997); Friedman (2001), where the ensemble evolves through first-order additive updates, we study second-order recursive architectures in which each predictor depends on its two immediate predecessors. These Fibonacci flows induce a learning dynamic with memory, allowing ensembles to integrate past structure while adapting to new residual information. We introduce a general family of recursive weight-update algorithms encompassing Fibonacci, tribonacci, and higher-order recursions, together with continuous-time limits that yield systems of differential equations governing ensemble evolution. We establish global convergence conditions, spectral stability criteria, and non-asymptotic generalization bounds under Rademacher Bartlett and Mendelson (2002) and algorithmic stability analyses. The resulting theory unifies recursive ensembles, structured weighting, and dynamical systems viewpoints in statistical learning. Experiments with kernel ridge regression Rasmussen and Williams (2006), spline smoothers Wahba (1990), and random Fourier feature models Rahimi and Recht (2007) demonstrate that recursive flows consistently improve approximation and generalization beyond static weighting.

Closed-loop reachable sets are efficiently computed in the lifted space and mapped back to the original state space via NN verification tools. To capture model mismatch between the Koopman dynamics and the true system, we apply conformal prediction to produce statistically-valid error bounds that inflate the reachable sets to ensure the true trajectories are contained with a user-specified probability.

True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts. These findings uncover a fundamental trade-off between perceptual grounding and temporal reasoning, indicating that narrative understanding emerges only from their integration. NarrativeTrack provides the first systematic framework to diagnose and advance temporally grounded narrative comprehension in MLLMs."}

We show that some existing formulations of the point-to-hyperplane distance can be recovered by our approach under specific settings. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the point-to-hyperplane distance in higher-rank symmetric spaces of noncompact type equipped with G-invariant Riemannian metrics. The derived distance then serves as a tool to design fully-connected (FC) layers and an attention mechanism for neural networks on the considered spaces.

The objective requires every selected tour to have a length at most $c|T^*|$ (where $|T^*|$ is the optimal tour length) while minimizing the average Jaccard similarity across all tour pairs. This formulation is crucial for applications requiring both high solution quality and fault tolerance, such as logistics planning, robotics pathfinding or strategic patrolling. Current methods are limited: traditional heuristics, such as the Niching Memetic Algorithm (NMA) or bi-criteria optimization, incur high computational complexity $O(n^3)$, while modern neural approaches (e.g., RF-MA3S) achieve limited diversity quality and rely on complex, external mechanisms.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that decomposes D-TSP into two efficient steps. First, we utilize a simple Graph Pointer Network (GPN), augmented with an approximated sequence entropy loss, to efficiently sample a large, diverse pool of high-quality tours. This simple modification effectively controls the quality-diversity trade-off without complex external mechanisms. Second, we apply a greedy algorithm that yields a 2-approximation for the dispersion problem to select the final $k$ maximally diverse tours from the generated pool. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On the Berlin instance, our model achieves an average Jaccard index of $0.015$, significantly outperforming NMA ($0.081$) and RF-MA3S. By leveraging GPU acceleration, our GPN structure achieves a near-linear empirical runtime growth of $O(n)$.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck. We integrate the resulting model into an annotation tool and show experimentally that it speeds up the annotation of SAR images."}

Existing deep learning (DL) approaches to temporal modeling face challenges in jointly capturing these dynamics over long fMRI time series. Among current DL models, transformers address long-range dependencies by explicitly modeling pairwise interactions through attention, but the associated quadratic computational cost limits effective integration of temporal dependencies across long fMRI sequences. Selective state-space models (SSMs) instead model long-range temporal dependencies implicitly through latent state evolution in a dynamical system, enabling efficient propagation of dependencies over time. However, recent SSM-based approaches for fMRI commonly operate on derived functional connectivity representations and employ single-scale temporal processing. These design choices constrain the ability to jointly represent fast transient dynamics and slower global trends within a single model. We propose NeuroSSM, a selective state-space architecture designed for end-to-end analysis of raw BOLD signals in fMRI time series. NeuroSSM addresses the above limitations through two complementary design components: a multiscale state-space backbone that captures fast and slow dynamics concurrently, and a parallel differencing branch that increases sensitivity to transient state changes.

In this setting, we show theoretically and empirically that the error of Laplace/BIC grows linearly with (d/2 minus lambda) times log n, where d is the ambient parameter dimension and lambda is the RLCT.

While exfiltration attacks are multi-step cyber attacks, we demonstrate that a single factor, the compressibility of model weights, significantly heightens exfiltration risk for large language models (LLMs). We tailor compression specifically for exfiltration by relaxing decompression constraints and demonstrate that attackers could achieve 16x to 100x compression with minimal trade-offs, reducing the time it would take for an attacker to illicitly transmit model weights from the defender's server from months to days. Finally, we study defenses designed to reduce exfiltration risk in three distinct ways: making models harder to compress, making them harder to 'find,' and tracking provenance for post-attack analysis using forensic watermarks. While all defenses are promising, the forensic watermark defense is both effective and cheap, and therefore is a particularly attractive lever for mitigating weight-exfiltration risk."}

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node. This is a disadvantage, but the speedup advantage is more significant, and in practice we find that RMCTS-trained networks match the quality of MCTS-UCB-trained networks in roughly one-third of the training time. We include timing and quality comparisons of RMCTS vs. MCTS-UCB for three games: Connect-4, Dots-and-Boxes, and Othello."}

Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.\n  We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur."}

Our proposed concave certificate establishes a tight bound of DR risk that remains applicable to non-Lipschitz and non-differentiable losses. We extend this framework to complexity analysis, introducing a deterministic bound that complements standard statistical generalization bound. Furthermore, we utilize this certificate to bound the gap between adversarial and empirical Rademacher complexity, demonstrating that dependencies on input diameter, network width, and depth can be eliminated. For practical application in deep learning, we introduce the adversarial score as a tractable relaxation of the concave certificate that enables efficient and layer-wise analysis of neural networks. We validate our theoretical results in various numerical experiments on classification and regression tasks on real-world data."}

To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block. The proposed framework demonstrates that state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning can be achieved without quadratic attention, thus opening up avenues for long-context VLMs that can deal with high-resolution images and long videos."}

We introduce TTC-aware training, where an intermediate checkpoint and a corresponding TTC configuration can together match or exceed the accuracy of a fully trained model while requiring substantially fewer training FLOPs. Building on this insight, we propose an early stopping algorithm that jointly selects a checkpoint and TTC configuration to minimize training compute without sacrificing accuracy. To make this practical, we develop an efficient TTC evaluation method that avoids exhaustive search, and we formalize a break-even bound that identifies when increased inference compute compensates for reduced training compute. Experiments demonstrate up to 92\\% reductions in training FLOPs while maintaining and sometimes remarkably improving accuracy.

However, a critical gap that persists in current methods is their inability to provide an explanation based on genes for each cell they have detected as rare. We identify three primary sources of this deficiency. First, the anomaly detectors often function as \"black boxes\", designed to detect anomalies but unable to explain why a cell is anomalous. Second, the standard analytical framework hinders interpretability by relying on dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which transform meaningful gene expression data into abstract, uninterpretable features. Finally, existing explanation algorithms cannot be readily applied to this domain, as single-cell data is characterized by high dimensionality, noise, and substantial sparsity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework for explainable anomaly detection in single-cell transcriptomics data which not only identifies individual anomalies, but also provides a visual explanation based on genes that makes an instance anomalous. This framework has two key ingredients that are not existed in current methods applied in this domain. First, it eliminates the PCA step which is deemed to be an essential component in previous studies. Second, it employs the state-of-art anomaly detector and explainer as the efficient and effective means to find each rare cell and the relevant gene subspace in order to provide explanations for each rare cell as well as the typical normal cell associated with the rare cell's closest normal cells."}

In this work, we look at a critical gap in the calibration of LLMs within multilingual settings, in an attempt to better understand how the data scarcity can potentially lead to different calibration effects and how commonly used techniques can apply in these settings. Our analysis on two multilingual benchmarks, over 29 and 42 languages respectively, reveals that even in low-resource languages, model confidence can increase significantly after instruction-tuning on high-resource language SFT datasets. However, improvements in accuracy are marginal or non-existent, resulting in mis-calibration, highlighting a critical shortcoming of standard SFT for multilingual languages. Furthermore, we observe that the use of label smoothing to be a reasonable method alleviate this concern, again without any need for low-resource SFT data, maintaining better calibration across all languages. Overall, this highlights the importance of multilingual considerations for both training and tuning LLMs in order to improve their reliability and fairness in downstream use."}

Our formulation runs in parallel with classical notions of (local) stationarity and strong mixing, while neither framework fully subsumes the other. Remarkably, SGD is shown to automatically accommodate both independent and dependent information under a broad class of stepsize schedules and exploration rate schemes.\n  Non-asymptotically, we show that SGD simultaneously achieves statistically optimal estimation error and regret, extending and improving existing results. In particular, our tail bounds remain sharp even for potentially infinite horizon $T=+\\infty$. Asymptotically, the SGD iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution with only an $O_{\\PP}(1/\\sqrt{t})$ remainder, demonstrating that the supposed estimation-regret trade-off claimed in prior work can in fact be avoided. We further propose a new ``conic'' approximation of the decision region that allows the covariates to have unbounded support.

A Bayesian negative binomial regression is applied, with days on chart as the outcome and collaboration status (solo versus multi-artist) and log total streams as predictors. This approach is well suited for overdispersed count data and allows the effect of collaboration to be interpreted while controlling for overall popularity.

To leverage this, we propose Lancet, a novel framework that achieves precise neural intervention by leveraging structural entropy and hallucination difference ratios. Lancet first locates hallucination-prone neurons via gradient-driven contrastive analysis, then maps their propagation pathways by minimizing structural entropy, and finally implements a hierarchical intervention strategy that preserves general model capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations across hallucination benchmark datasets demonstrate that Lancet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our surgical approach to neural intervention."}

To address these issues, we present the Decoupled-experts Arbitration Few-Shot SegNet (DA-FSS), a model that effectively distinguishes between semantic and geometric paths and mutually regularizes their gradients to achieve better generalization. DA-FSS employs the same backbone and pre-trained text encoder as MM-FSS to generate text embeddings, which can increase free modalities' utilization rate and better leverage each modality's information space. To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation.

We propose a latent state-space framework that jointly models (i) traffic dynamics via a linear dynamical system and (ii) sensor dropout via a Bernoulli observation channel whose probability depends on the latent traffic state. Inference uses an Extended Kalman Filter with Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing, and parameters are learned via an approximate EM procedure with a dedicated update for detector-specific missingness parameters. On the Seattle inductive loop detector data, introducing latent dynamics yields large gains over naive baselines, reducing blackout imputation RMSE from 7.02 (LOCF) and 5.02 (linear interpolation + seasonal naive) to 4.23 (MAR LDS), corresponding to about a 64% reduction in MSE relative to LOCF. Explicit MNAR modeling provides a consistent but smaller additional improvement on real data (imputation RMSE 4.20; 0.8% RMSE reduction relative to MAR), with similar modest gains for short-horizon post-blackout forecasts (evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 steps). In controlled synthetic experiments, the MNAR advantage increases as the true missingness dependence on latent state strengthens.

This result improves upon previously known bounds and matches a lower bound from Duetting et al. [2025] up to constant factors, thereby proving its optimality. Our analysis uses a chaining argument, where the key insight is to leverage a simple structural property of linear contracts: their expected reward is non-decreasing. This property, which holds even though the utility function itself is non-monotone and discontinuous, enables the construction of fine-grained nets required for the chaining argument, which in turn yields the optimal sample complexity. Furthermore, our proof establishes the stronger guarantee of uniform convergence: the empirical utility of every linear contract is a $\\varepsilon$-approximation of its true expectation with probability at least $1-δ$, using the same optimal $O(\\ln(1/δ) / \\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity."}

In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.\n  Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that, in terms of the Le Cam deficiency distance, a quantum walk with randomization is asymptotically equivalent to underdamped Langevin dynamics, whereas the quantum walk without randomization is not asymptotically equivalent due to its high-frequency oscillatory behavior. We further discuss the implications of these equivalence and nonequivalence results for the computational and inferential properties of the associated algorithms in machine learning tasks. Our findings offer new insight into the relationship between quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as the intrinsic mechanisms underlying quantum speedup and classical gradient acceleration."}

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding."}

To reconcile generative structure with discriminative performance, we introduce the \\emph{Discriminative Negative Log-Likelihood} (DNLL) loss, which augments the LDA log-likelihood with a simple penalty on the mixture density. DNLL can be interpreted as standard LDA NLL plus a term that explicitly discourages regions where several classes are simultaneously likely.

However, despite rapid advances in machine learning, existing approaches remain crop- or region-specific and require data engineering efforts. This limits scalability, reproducibility, and operational deployment. This study introduces UniCrop, a universal and reusable data pipeline designed to automate the acquisition, cleaning, harmonisation, and engineering of multi-source environmental data for crop yield prediction. For any given location, crop type, and temporal window, UniCrop automatically retrieves, harmonises, and engineers over 200 environmental variables (Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ERA5-Land, NASA POWER, SoilGrids, and SRTM), reducing them to a compact, analysis-ready feature set utilising a structured feature reduction workflow with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). To validate, UniCrop was applied to a rice yield dataset comprising 557 field observations. Using only the selected 15 features, four baseline machine learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Elastic Net) were trained. LightGBM achieved the best single-model performance (RMSE = 465.1 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6576$), while a constrained ensemble of all baselines further improved accuracy (RMSE = 463.2 kg/ha, $R^2 = 0.6604$). UniCrop contributes a scalable and transparent data-engineering framework that addresses the primary bottleneck in operational crop yield modelling: the preparation of consistent and harmonised multi-source data. By decoupling data specification from implementation and supporting any crop, region, and time frame through simple configuration updates, UniCrop provides a practical foundation for scalable agricultural analytics.

While classical LDA is a simple Gaussian model with linear decision boundaries, attaching an LDA head to a neural encoder raises the question of how to train the resulting deep classifier by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We first show that end-to-end MLE training of an unconstrained Deep LDA model ignores discrimination: when both the LDA parameters and the encoder parameters are learned jointly, the likelihood admits a degenerate solution in which some of the class clusters may heavily overlap or even collapse, and classification performance deteriorates. Batchwise moment re-estimation of the LDA parameters does not remove this failure mode. We then propose a constrained Deep LDA formulation that fixes the class means to the vertices of a regular simplex in the latent space and restricts the shared covariance to be spherical, leaving only the priors and a single variance parameter to be learned along with the encoder. Under these geometric constraints, MLE becomes stable and yields well-separated class clusters in the latent space. On images (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), the resulting Deep LDA models achieve accuracy competitive with softmax baselines while offering a simple, interpretable latent geometry that is clearly visible in two-dimensional projections."}

Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\\times$."}

To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%.

The challenges stem from the accumulation of noise in high-dimensional features, the limitations of non-convex optimization formulations, and the computational complexity of identifying meaningful biclusters.

To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack."}

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."}

When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision. Experimental results show that SafeLoad achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with low online and offline time overhead. Specifically, SafeLoad improves precision by up to 66% over the best baseline and reduces wasted CPU time by up to 8.09x compared to scenarios without SafeLoad."}

Springer, Cham", "summary": "The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration."}

During the inversion process, the conductivity model is iteratively updated using the Gauss Newton method, while the model space is constrained by projections onto the learned VAE decoder.

On the visual side, it employs structured attention-guided erasure to suppress background activations and enforce orthogonal prediction consistency between causal and spurious regions. On the textual side, it introduces balanced prompt normalization, a learnable re-centering mechanism that aligns class embeddings toward an isotropic semantic space. Together, these modules jointly minimize conditional mutual information between spurious cues and predictions, steering the model toward causal, domain invariant reasoning without retraining or domain supervision. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic bias benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both average and worst-group accuracies over prior test-time debiasing methods, establishing a lightweight yet effective path toward trustworthy and causally grounded vision-language adaptation."}

While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering."}

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models.

Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework that employs generative neural networks to enable fast, likelihood-free posterior inference. We adapt ABI to graph data to address these challenges to perform inference on node-, edge-, and graph-level parameters. Our approach couples permutation-invariant graph encoders with flexible neural posterior estimators in a two-module pipeline: a summary network maps attributed graphs to fixed-length representations, and an inference network approximates the posterior over parameters.

In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters.

Earlier work (e.g., Jain et al., NeurIPS 2023 for counting distinct elements; Raskhodnikova & Steiner, PODS 2025 for triangle counting with edge updates) reduced the respective cardinality estimation problem to continual counting on the difference stream associated with the true function values on the input stream. In such reductions, a change in the original stream can cause many changes in the difference stream, this poses a challenge for applying private continual counting algorithms to obtain optimal error bounds. We improve the accuracy of several such reductions by studying the associated $\\ell_p$-sensitivity vectors of the resulting difference streams and isolating their properties.\n  We demonstrate that our framework gives improved bounds for counting distinct elements, estimating degree histograms, and estimating triangle counts (under a slightly relaxed privacy model), thus offering a general approach to private continual cardinality estimation in streaming settings. Our improved accuracy stems from tight analysis of known factorization mechanisms for the counting matrix in this setting; the key technical challenge is arguing that one can use state-of-the-art factorizations for sensitivity vector sets with the properties we isolate. Empirically and analytically, we demonstrate that our improved error bounds offer a substantial improvement in accuracy for cardinality estimation problems over a large range of parameters."}

Samad"], "title": "Predicting Early and Complete Drug Release from Long-Acting Injectables Using Explainable Machine Learning", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available."}

Full fine-tuning is computationally expensive and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose \\textbf{TopoLoRA-SAM}, a topology-aware and parameter-efficient adaptation framework for binary semantic segmentation. TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former. TopoLoRA-SAM achieves the best retina-average Dice and the best overall average Dice across datasets, while training only \\textbf{5.2\\%} of model parameters ($\\sim$4.9M). On the challenging CHASE\\_DB1 dataset, our method substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, demonstrating that topology-aware parameter-efficient adaptation can match or exceed fully fine-tuned specialist models.

Despite its theoretical appeal, this strategy frequently underperforms empirical risk minimization (ERM) in practice. We investigate the source of this gap and show that such failures naturally arise when only a subset of the true causes of the outcome is observed. In these settings, non-causal spurious covariates can serve as informative proxies for unobserved causes and substantially improve prediction, except under distribution shifts that break these proxy relationships. Consequently, the optimal set of predictive covariates is neither universal nor necessarily exhibits invariant relationships with the outcome across all environments, but instead depends on the specific type of shift encountered. Crucially, we observe that different covariate shifts induce distinct, observable signatures in the covariate distribution itself. Moreover, these signatures can be extracted from unlabeled data in the target OOD environment and used to assess when proxy covariates remain reliable and when they fail. Building on this observation, we propose an environment-adaptive covariate selection (EACS) algorithm that maps environment-level covariate summaries to environment-specific covariate sets, while allowing the incorporation of prior causal knowledge as constraints. Across simulations and applied datasets, EACS consistently outperforms static causal, invariant, and ERM-based predictors under diverse distribution shifts."}

We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive."}

Deep learning models can detect diseases from leaf images with high accuracy, but these models are typically too large and computationally expensive to run on low-cost edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, collecting thousands of labeled disease images for training is both expensive and time-consuming. This paper addresses both challenges by combining neural network pruning -- removing unnecessary parts of the model -- with few-shot learning, which enables the model to learn from limited examples. This paper proposes Disease-Aware Channel Importance Scoring (DACIS), a method that identifies which parts of the neural network are most important for distinguishing between different plant diseases, integrated into a three-stage Prune-then-Meta-Learn-then-Prune (PMP) pipeline. Experiments on PlantVillage and PlantDoc datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces model size by 78\\% while maintaining 92.3\\% of the original accuracy, with the compressed model running at 7 frames per second on a Raspberry Pi 4, making real-time field diagnosis practical for smallholder farmers."}
