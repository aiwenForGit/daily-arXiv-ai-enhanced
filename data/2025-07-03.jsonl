While effective, these\nmethods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic\ndata, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose\nFSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on\nlarge-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes\nexhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or\npartially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly\npresent. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),\nwhich dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific\noptimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen\ndata. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based\non MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic\nfeatures for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we\nintroduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training\na semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.\nExperiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves\ncompetitive performance using far fewer synthetic features."}

To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight\ncompression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance\ndegradation.

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized.

To address\nthis, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)\ndecomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers.

HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes\nand two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters\nwith CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal\nmapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,\nNormalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis\nfurther supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39\nmeteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies\n30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose\nidentification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior\nperformance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful\nselection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally\nconsistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical\ncoherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically\nconsistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further\nvalidation is needed to assess physical validity."}

However, this task remains a significant\nchallenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as\nwell as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often\ncompounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and\ntransformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with\nstable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These\nmethods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps\nand capture essential boundary cues.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for\nrobust polyp segmentation.

By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments.
