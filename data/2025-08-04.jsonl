To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors.

NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy."}

To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model.

Consequently, our study is dedicated to\naddressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color\nimages of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area\nsurrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between\nthem. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features\nfor gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate\nthe model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL\nand (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding\naccuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a\ncommendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters\n(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of\nour proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we\nevaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it\nwith other state-of-the-art approaches.

Our\npipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining\ninitial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.\nRhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier\ntrained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,\nTraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with\npractical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent\nretrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is\navailable."}

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on\ninternal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook\na core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions\nand judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic\ncourtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,\nrelevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG\nevaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court\ndecisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline\ntailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input\nconfigurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as\nLLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval.

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility."}

The SU-ESRGAN produces results\n(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery.

The\nmodular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or\npost-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression\nand sensor limitations.

Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices\nperformance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We\naddress the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to\nimprove its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -\nfor example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control\n(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its\nworst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we\ncharacterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for\nclasses of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting\nfrom a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the\nmodifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our\nresults apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for\nnonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for\nstrongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over\npolyhedral feasibility sets.

A key step in Bellman dynamic programming\nalgorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in\ninfinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward\nformulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation\ntechniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting\nstructural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a\nstructured class of MDPs.

When a policy\ninduces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into\ninteracting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and\nefficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a\nscalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs."}
