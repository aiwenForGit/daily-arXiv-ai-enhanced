Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy."}

To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model.

This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate\nthe model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL\nand (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding\naccuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a\ncommendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters\n(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset.

While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on\ninternal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook\na core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions\nand judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic\ncourtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,\nrelevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG\nevaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court\ndecisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline\ntailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input\nconfigurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as\nLLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval.

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility."}

The SU-ESRGAN produces results\n(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery.

In particular, starting\nfrom a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the\nmodifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our\nresults apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for\nnonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for\nstrongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over\npolyhedral feasibility sets.

A key step in Bellman dynamic programming\nalgorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in\ninfinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward\nformulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation\ntechniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting\nstructural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a\nstructured class of MDPs.
