In this theoretical work, we propose \\textbf{Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI)}, a formal framework rooted in algebraic topology that unifies learning and memory as phase transitions of a single geometric substrate. Central to our theory is the \\textbf{Homological Parity Principle}, which posits a fundamental dichotomy: even-dimensional homology ($H_{even}$) physically instantiates stable \\textbf{Content} (stable scaffolds or ``what''), while odd-dimensional homology ($H_{odd}$) instantiates dynamic \\textbf{Context} (dynamic flows or ``where''). We derive the logical flow of MAI as a topological trinity transformation: \\textbf{Search $\\to$ Closure $\\to$ Structure}. Specifically, we demonstrate that cognition operates by converting high-complexity recursive search (modeled by \\textit{Savitch's Theorem} in NPSPACE) into low-complexity lookup (modeled by \\textit{Dynamic Programming} in P) via the mechanism of \\textbf{Topological Cycle Closure}. We further show that this consolidation process is governed by a topological generalization of the Wake-Sleep algorithm, functioning as a coordinate descent that alternates between optimizing the $H_{odd}$ flow (inference/wake) and condensing persistent cycles into the $H_{even}$ scaffold (learning/sleep). This framework offers a rigorous explanation for the emergence of fast-thinking (intuition) from slow-thinking (reasoning) and provides a blueprint for post-Turing architectures that compute via topological resonance."}

They pose significant risks to human health, making their accurate detection the crux of efforts to monitor and minimize exposure. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy enables the ultrasensitive detection at low-concentrations of VOCs in the atmosphere by measuring their IR absorption spectra. However, the complexity of the IR spectra limits the possibility to implement VOC recognition and quantification in real-time. While deep neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used for the recognition of complex data structures, they typically require massive datasets for the training phase. Here, we create an experimental VOC dataset for nine different classes of compounds at various concentrations, using their IR absorption spectra. To further increase the amount of spectra and their diversity in term of VOC concentration, we augment the experimental dataset with synthetic spectra created via conditional generative NNs. This allows us to train robust discriminative NNs, able to reliably identify the nine VOCs, as well as to precisely predict their concentrations. The trained NN is suitable to be incorporated into sensing devices for VOCs recognition and analysis."}

However, we demonstrate that such synthetic releases can still leak information about the underlying training samples through structural overlap in the data manifold. We propose a black-box membership inference attack that exploits this vulnerability without requiring access to model internals or real data. The attacker repeatedly queries the generative model to obtain large numbers of synthetic samples, performs unsupervised clustering to identify dense regions of the synthetic distribution, and then analyzes cluster medoids and neighborhoods that correspond to high-density regions in the original training data. These neighborhoods act as proxies for training samples, enabling the adversary to infer membership or reconstruct approximate records. Our experiments across healthcare, finance, and other sensitive domains show that cluster overlap between real and synthetic data leads to measurable membership leakage-even when the generator is trained with differential privacy or other noise mechanisms. The results highlight an under-explored attack surface in synthetic data generation pipelines and call for stronger privacy guarantees that account for distributional neighborhood inference rather than sample-level memorization alone, underscoring its role in privacy-preserving data publishing.

The MDL endows CompressARC with extreme generalization abilities typically unheard of in deep learning. To our knowledge, CompressARC is the only deep learning method for ARC-AGI where training happens only on a single sample: the target inference puzzle itself, with the final solution information removed. Moreover, CompressARC does not train on the pre-provided ARC-AGI \"training set\". Under these extremely data-limited conditions, we do not ordinarily expect any puzzles to be solvable at all.

However, many U.S. DOTs struggle to obtain accurate AADT, especially for unmonitored roads. While continuous count (CC) stations offer accurate traffic volume data, their implementation is expensive and difficult to deploy widely, compelling agencies to rely on short-duration traffic counts. This study proposes a machine learning framework, the first to our knowledge, to identify optimal representative days for conducting short count (SC) data collection to improve AADT prediction accuracy. Using 2022 and 2023 traffic volume data from the state of Texas, we compare two scenarios: an 'optimal day' approach that iteratively selects the most informative days for AADT estimation and a 'no optimal day' baseline reflecting current practice by most DOTs. To align with Texas DOT's traffic monitoring program, continuous count data were utilized to simulate the 24 hour short counts. The actual field short counts were used to enhance feature engineering through using a leave-one-out (LOO) technique to generate unbiased representative daily traffic features across similar road segments. Our proposed methodology outperforms the baseline across the top five days, with the best day (Day 186) achieving lower errors (RMSE: 7,871.15, MAE: 3,645.09, MAPE: 11.95%) and higher R^2 (0.9756) than the baseline (RMSE: 11,185.00, MAE: 5,118.57, MAPE: 14.42%, R^2: 0.9499).

Despite advances, it is as of yet challenging for existing methodological frameworks to integrate multimodal data for longitudinal personalized forecasting while maintaining interpretability. To address this gap, we present the Neural Koopman Machine (NKM), a new machine learning architecture inspired by dynamical systems and attention mechanisms, designed to forecast multiple cognitive scores simultaneously using multimodal genetic, neuroimaging, proteomic, and demographic data. NKM integrates analytical ($α$) and biological ($β$) knowledge to guide feature grouping and control the hierarchical attention mechanisms to extract relevant patterns. By implementing Fusion Group-Aware Hierarchical Attention within the Koopman operator framework, NKM transforms complex nonlinear trajectories into interpretable linear representations. To demonstrate NKM's efficacy, we applied it to study the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our results suggest that NKM consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in forecasting trajectories of cognitive decline. Specifically, NKM (1) forecasts changes of multiple cognitive scores simultaneously, (2) quantifies differential biomarker contributions to predicting distinctive cognitive scores, and (3) identifies brain regions most predictive of cognitive deterioration. Together, NKM advances personalized, interpretable forecasting of future cognitive decline in AD using past multimodal data through an explainable, explicit system and reveals potential multimodal biological underpinnings of AD progression."}

This is because the vast majority of existing methodologies exploit various levels of approximations that lower accuracy and limit the flexibility of kernel and noise-model designs -- an unacceptable drawback at a time when expressive non-stationary kernels are on the rise in many fields. Here, we propose a methodology we term \\emph{gp2Scale} that scales exact Gaussian processes to more than 10 million data points without relying on inducing points, kernel interpolation, or neighborhood-based approximations, and instead leveraging the existing capabilities of a GP: its kernel design. Highly flexible, compactly supported, and non-stationary kernels lead to the identification of naturally occurring sparse structure in the covariance matrix, which is then exploited for the calculations of the linear system solution and the log-determinant for training. We demonstrate our method's functionality on several real-world datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms. Although we show superior approximation performance in many cases, the method's real power lies in its agnosticism toward arbitrary GP customizations -- core kernel design, noise, and mean functions -- and the type of input space, making it optimally suited for modern Gaussian process applications."}

We identify limitations in existing approaches for invariant representation learning that solely rely on classical information-theoretic measures, motivating the need to precisely focus on redundant information about the target $Y$ shared between spurious subgraphs $G_s$ and invariant subgraphs $G_c$ obtained via PID. Next, we propose a new multi-level optimization framework that we call -- Redundancy-guided Invariant Graph learning (RIG) -- that maximizes redundant information while isolating spurious and causal subgraphs, enabling OOD generalization under diverse distribution shifts. Our approach relies on alternating between estimating a lower bound of redundant information (which itself requires an optimization) and maximizing it along with additional objectives. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed RIG framework."}

Our approach trains a diffusion prior directly on sparsely observed speed fields using two mask-aware training strategies: Single-Mask and Double-Mask. At the inference phase, the physics-guided posterior sampler alternates reverse-diffusion updates, observation projection, and physics-guided projection based on adaptive anisotropic smoothing to reconstruct the missing speed fields. The proposed framework is tested on the I-24 MOTION dataset with varying visibility ratios. Even under severe sparsity, with only 5% visibility, PMA-Diffusion outperforms other baselines across three reconstruction error metrics. Furthermore, PMA-diffusion trained with sparse observation nearly matches the performance of the baseline model trained on fully observed speed fields. The results indicate that combining mask-aware diffusion priors with a physics-guided posterior sampler provides a reliable and flexible solution for traffic state estimation under realistic sensing sparsity."}

We propose \\emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\\partial y_s/\\partial x_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{c\\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\\in\\{t+1,\\dots,T\\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms.

We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context."}

This work asks a simple question: how do existing backdoor defenses behave under standard quantization pipelines? We conduct a systematic empirical study of five representative defenses across three precision settings (FP32, INT8 dynamic, INT4 simulated) and two standard vision benchmarks using a canonical BadNet attack. We observe that INT8 quantization reduces the detection rate of all evaluated defenses to 0% while leaving attack success rates above 99%. For INT4, we find a pronounced dataset dependence: Neural Cleanse remains effective on GTSRB but fails on CIFAR-10, even though backdoors continue to survive quantization with attack success rates above 90%. Our results expose a mismatch between how defenses are commonly evaluated (on FP32 models) and how models are actually deployed (in quantized form), and they highlight quantization robustness as a necessary axis in future evaluations and designs of backdoor defenses."}

Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(ε^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $ε$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence."}

This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\\%) to apply based on observed progress signals.

On a modified Gym Reacher task, we investigate possible explanations for the failure of continuing SAC when learning without embodiment resets. Our results suggest that embodiment resets help with exploration of the state space in the SAC algorithm, and removing embodiment resets can lead to poor exploration of the state space and failure of or significantly slower learning. Finally, on additional simulated tasks and a real-robot vision task, we show that increasing the entropy of the policy when performance trends worse or remains static is an effective intervention for recovering the performance lost due to not using embodiment resets."}

However, traditional RMABs assume independence among arms, limiting their ability to account for interactions between individuals that can be common and significant in a real-world environment. This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist."}

We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes."}

Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores.

The standard objective used in reward modeling is the Bradley-Terry (BT) loss, which learns from pairwise data consisting of a pair of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we analyze the per-sample gradient of BT-loss and show that its norm scales with two distinct components: (1) the difference in predicted rewards between chosen and rejected responses, which reflects the prediction error, and critically, (2) representation distance between the pair measured in the output space of the final layer. While the first term captures the intended training signal, we show that the second term can significantly impact the update magnitude and misalign learning. Specifically, pairs with small representation distance often receive vanishingly weak updates, even when misranked, while pairs with large distance receive disproportionately strong updates. This leads to gradients from large-distance pairs to overshadow those from small-distance pairs, where fine-grained distinctions are especially important. To overcome this limitation, we propose NormBT, an adaptive pair-wise normalization scheme that balances representation-driven effects and focuses learning signals on prediction error. NormBT is a lightweight, drop-in integration to BT loss with negligible overhead. Across various LLM backbones and datasets, NormBT improves reward model performance consistently, with notable gains of over 5% on the Reasoning category of RewardBench, which contains numerous small-distance pairs. This work reveals a key limitation in the widely used BT objective and provides a simple, effective correction."}

Understanding the high generalization ability of large-scale models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) remains one of the central open problems in machine learning theory. While recent theoretical studies have attributed this phenomenon to the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) toward well-generalizing solutions, empirical evidences indicate that it primarily stems from properties of the model itself. Specifically, even randomly sampled interpolators, which are parameters that achieve zero training error, have been observed to generalize effectively. In this study, under a teacher-student framework, we prove that the generalization error of randomly sampled interpolators becomes exactly zero once the number of training samples exceeds a threshold determined by the geometric structure of the interpolator set in parameter space.

Feature propagation (FP) is a well-known method that performs well for imputation of missing node features on graphs, but it still has the following three issues: 1) it struggles with graphs that are not fully connected, 2) imputed features face the over-smoothing problem, and 3) FP is tailored for transductive tasks, overlooking the feature distribution shift in inductive tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce DDFI, a Diverse and Distribution-aware Missing Feature Imputation method that combines feature propagation with a graph-based Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) in a nontrivial manner. It first designs a simple yet effective algorithm, namely Co-Label Linking (CLL), that randomly connects nodes in the training set with the same label to enhance the performance on graphs with numerous connected components. Then we develop a novel two-step representation generation process at the inference stage. Specifically, instead of directly using FP-imputed features as input during inference, DDFI further reconstructs the features through the whole MAE to reduce feature distribution shift in the inductive tasks and enhance the diversity of node features. Meanwhile, since existing feature imputation methods for graphs only evaluate by simulating the missing scenes with manually masking the features, we collect a new dataset called Sailing from the records of voyages that contains naturally missing features to help better evaluate the effectiveness. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets and Sailing show that DDFI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under both transductive and inductive settings."}

Artificial intelligence techniques, which use a neural network component in various forms, have recently frequently been used to accomplish this step.

In this paper, a method inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach is investigated to enhance the performance of neural network models used for multi-step ahead prediction of periodic time-series information while maintaining a negligible impact on the complexity of the system. The PID-based method is applied to the predicted value at each time step to bring that value closer to the real value. The water demand forecasting problem is considered as a case study, where two deep neural network models from the literature are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed boosting method. Furthermore, to prove the applicability of this PID-based booster to other types of periodic time-series prediction problems, it is applied to enhance the accuracy of a neural network model used for multi-step forecasting of hourly energy consumption. The comparison between the results of the original prediction models and the results after using the proposed technique demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and system complexity."}

To achieve this, we identify a closed-form expression for the initialisation of the parameters, differing from the original \\texttt{SIREN} scheme. This expression is derived from fixed points obtained through the convergence of pre-activation distribution and the variance of Jacobian sequences. Controlling both gradients and targeting vanishing pre-activation helps preventing the emergence of inappropriate frequencies during estimation, thereby improving generalization. We further show that this initialisation strongly influences training dynamics through the Neural Tangent Kernel framework (NTK).

Unlike existing pruning methods that rely on the inherent \"Importance\" of neurons' and filters' weights, ``Expressiveness\" emphasizes a neuron's or group of neurons ability to redistribute informational resources effectively, based on the overlap of activations. This characteristic is strongly correlated to a network's initialization state, establishing criterion autonomy from the learning state stateless and thus setting a new fundamental basis for the expansion of compression strategies in regards to the \"When to Prune\" question. We show that expressiveness is effectively approximated with arbitrary data or limited dataset's representative samples, making ground for the exploration of Data-Agnostic strategies. Our work also facilitates a \"hybrid\" formulation of expressiveness and importance-based pruning strategies, illustrating their complementary benefits and delivering up to 10x extra gains w.r.t. weight-based approaches in parameter compression ratios, with an average of 1% in performance degradation.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes BitStopper, a fine-grained algorithm-architecture co-design that operates without a sparsity predictor. First, a bit-serial enable stage fusion (BESF) mechanism is proposed to reuse and minimize the memory access by progressively terminating trivial tokens and merging the prediction stage into the execution stage.

In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of decoding-based regression via Reinforcement Learning (RL). We formulate the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing sequence-level rewards to enforce global numerical coherence.

We show that two of the most commonly used benchmark data sets - GossipCop and PolitiFact - are poorly suited to evaluating the utility of models that use propagation structure. Specifically, these data sets exhibit shallow, ego-like graph topologies that provide little or no ability to differentiate among modeling methods. We systematically benchmark five GNN architectures against a structure-agnostic multilayer perceptron (MLP) that uses the same node features. We show that MLPs match or closely trail the performance of GNNs, with performance gaps often within 1-2% and overlapping confidence intervals. To isolate the contribution of structure in these datasets, we conduct controlled experiments where node features are shuffled or edge structures randomized. We find that performance collapses under feature shuffling but remains stable under edge randomization. This suggests that structure plays a negligible role in these benchmarks. Structural analysis further reveals that over 75% of nodes are only one hop from the root, exhibiting minimal structural diversity. In contrast, on synthetic datasets where node features are noisy and structure is informative, GNNs significantly outperform MLPs. These findings provide strong evidence that widely used benchmarks do not meaningfully test the utility of modeling structural features, and they motivate the development of datasets with richer, more diverse graph topologies."}

Fraud is difficult to detect because of covert tactics and the high labor and time costs of audits. Traditional statistical models are interpretable but struggle with nonlinear feature interactions, while machine learning models are powerful but often opaque. In addition, most existing methods judge fraud only for the current year based on current year data, limiting timeliness.\n  This paper proposes a financial fraud detection framework for Chinese A-share listed companies based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We design a feature engineering scheme that transforms firm-year panel data into image like representations, enabling the CNN to capture cross-sectional and temporal patterns and to predict fraud in advance. Experiments show that the CNN outperforms logistic regression and LightGBM in accuracy, robustness, and early-warning performance, and that proper tuning of the classification threshold is crucial in high-risk settings.\n  To address interpretability, we analyze the model along the dimensions of entity, feature, and time using local explanation techniques. We find that solvency, ratio structure, governance structure, and internal control are general predictors of fraud, while environmental indicators matter mainly in high-pollution industries. Non-fraud firms share stable feature patterns, whereas fraud firms exhibit heterogeneous patterns concentrated in short time windows. A case study of Guanong Shares in 2022 shows that cash flow analysis, social responsibility, governance structure, and per-share indicators are the main drivers of the model's fraud prediction, consistent with the company's documented misconduct."}

By contrast, traffic monitoring systems are widely deployed in cities around the world, highlighting the imbalance between what we know about traffic conditions and what do not know about their environmental consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose a machine learning-driven system that extracts visual information from traffic video to capture vehicles behaviors and conditions. Combining these features with weather data, our model estimates BC at street level, achieving an R-squared value of 0.72 and RMSE of 129.42 ng/m3 (nanogram per cubic meter).

In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task.

Many defenses are typically either black-box guardrails that filter outputs, or internals-based methods that steer hidden activations by operationalizing safety as a single latent feature or dimension. While effective for simple concepts, this assumption is limiting, as recent evidence shows that abstract concepts such as refusal and temporality are distributed across multiple features rather than isolated in one. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Regularized Sparse Autoencoders (GSAEs), which extends SAEs with a Laplacian smoothness penalty on the neuron co-activation graph. Unlike standard SAEs that assign each concept to a single latent feature, GSAEs recover smooth, distributed safety representations as coherent patterns spanning multiple features. We empirically demonstrate that GSAE enables effective runtime safety steering, assembling features into a weighted set of safety-relevant directions and controlling them with a two-stage gating mechanism that activates interventions only when harmful prompts or continuations are detected during generation. This approach enforces refusals adaptively while preserving utility on benign queries. Across safety and QA benchmarks, GSAE steering achieves an average 82% selective refusal rate, substantially outperforming standard SAE steering (42%), while maintaining strong task accuracy (70% on TriviaQA, 65% on TruthfulQA, 74% on GSM8K). Robustness experiments further show generalization across LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi families and resilience against jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN), consistently maintaining >= 90% refusal of harmful content."}

However, this procedure is difficult because real-world datasets are rarely homogeneous; they consist of a mixture of diverse information, causing gradient interference, where conflicting gradients pull the model in opposing directions, degrading performance. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to group data based on semantic or embedding similarity. However, this fails to capture how data influences model parameters during learning. While recent works have attempted to cluster gradients directly, they randomly project gradients into lower dimensions to manage memory, which leads to accuracy loss. Moreover, these methods rely on expert ensembles which necessitates multiple inference passes and expensive on-the-fly gradient computations during inference. To address these limitations, we propose GradientSpace, a framework that clusters samples directly in full-dimensional gradient space. We introduce an online SVD-based algorithm that operates on LoRA gradients to identify latent skills without the infeasible cost of storing all sample gradients. Each cluster is used to train a specialized LoRA expert along with a lightweight router trained to select the best expert during inference. We show that routing to a single, appropriate expert outperforms expert ensembles used in prior work, while significantly reducing inference latency. Our experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, finance, and creative writing tasks demonstrate that GradientSpace leads to coherent expert specialization and consistent accuracy gains over state-of-the-art clustering methods and finetuning techniques."}

This paper proposes a novel multimodal-RUL framework that jointly leverages image representations (ImR) and time-frequency representations (TFR) of multichannel, nonstationary vibration signals. The architecture comprises three branches: (1) an ImR branch and (2) a TFR branch, both employing multiple dilated convolutional blocks with residual connections to extract spatial degradation features; and (3) a fusion branch that concatenates these features and feeds them into an LSTM to model temporal degradation patterns. A multi-head attention mechanism subsequently emphasizes salient features, followed by linear layers for final RUL regression. To enable effective multimodal learning, vibration signals are converted into ImR via the Bresenham line algorithm and into TFR using Continuous Wavelet Transform. We also introduce multimodal Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (multimodal-LRP), a tailored explainability technique that significantly enhances model transparency. The approach is validated on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA benchmark datasets.

Deep learning (DL) approaches provide the most accurate solutions for this purpose. However, they suffer from complexity problem due to the massive number of parameters, in addition to the high forecasting error at the extreme points. In this work, an effective method to alleviate the error at these points is proposed. It is based on extending the data by inserting virtual data within the actual data to relieve the nonlinearity around them. To our knowledge, this is the first work that considers the problem related to the extreme points. Moreover, the water demand forecasting model proposed in this work is a novel DL model with relatively low complexity. The basic model uses the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to handle the sequential relationship in the historical demand data, while an unsupervised classification method, K-means, is introduced for the creation of new features to enhance the prediction accuracy with less number of parameters. Real data obtained from two different water plants in China are used to train and verify the model proposed. The prediction results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art illustrate that the method proposed reduces the complexity of the model six times of what achieved in the literature while conserving the same accuracy. Furthermore, it is found that extending the data set significantly reduces the error by about 30%. However, it increases the training time."}

The KV cache grows with sequence length and embedding dimension, often exceeding the memory footprint of the model itself and limiting achievable batch sizes and context windows. To address this challenge, we present KV CAR, a unified and architecture agnostic framework that significantly reduces KV cache storage while maintaining model fidelity. KV CAR combines two complementary techniques. First, a lightweight autoencoder learns compact representations of key and value tensors along the embedding dimension, compressing them before they are stored in the KV cache and restoring them upon retrieval. Second, a similarity driven reuse mechanism identifies opportunities to reuse KV tensors of specific attention heads across adjacent layers. Together, these methods reduce the dimensional and structural redundancy in KV tensors without requiring changes to the transformer architecture. Evaluations on GPT 2 and TinyLLaMA models across Wikitext, C4, PIQA, and Winogrande datasets demonstrate that KV CAR achieves up to 47.85 percent KV cache memory reduction with minimal impact on perplexity and zero shot accuracy. System level measurements on an NVIDIA A40 GPU show that the reduced KV footprint directly translates into longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes during inference. These results highlight the effectiveness of KV CAR in enabling memory efficient LLM inference."}

Two configurations were evaluated to eliminate learning-rate bias: (i) both using ArcGD's effective learning rate and (ii) both using Adam's default learning rate. ArcGD consistently outperformed Adam under the first setting and, although slower under the second, achieved super ior final solutions in most cases. In the second evaluation, ArcGD is evaluated against state-of-the-art optimizers (Adam, AdamW, Lion, SGD) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset across 8 diverse MLP architectures ranging from 1 to 5 hidden layers. ArcGD achieved the highest average test accuracy (50.7%) at 20,000 iterations, outperforming AdamW (46.6%), Adam (46.8%), SGD (49.6%), and Lion (43.4%), winning or tying on 6 of 8 architectures. Notably, while Adam and AdamW showed strong early convergence at 5,000 iterations, but regressed with extended training, whereas ArcGD continued improving, demonstrating generalization and resistance to overfitting without requiring early stopping tuning. Strong performance on geometric stress tests and standard deep-learning benchmarks indicates broad applicability, highlighting the need for further exploration. Moreover, it is also shown that a variant of ArcGD can be interpreted as a special case of the Lion optimiser, highlighting connections between the inherent mechanisms of such optimisation methods."}

Since market participants are usually uncertain about their preferences in various online matching platforms, an emerging line of research is dedicated to the online setting where one-side participants (players) learn their unknown preferences through multiple rounds of interactions with the other side (arms). Sankararaman et al. provide an $Ω\\left( \\frac{N\\log(T)}{Δ^2} + \\frac{K\\log(T)}Δ \\right)$ regret lower bound for this problem under serial dictatorship assumption, where $N$ is the number of players, $K (\\geq N)$ is the number of arms, $Δ$ is the minimum reward gap across players and arms, and $T$ is the time horizon. Serial dictatorship assumes arms have the same preferences, which is common in reality when one side participants have a unified evaluation standard. Recently, the work of Kong and Li proposes the ET-GS algorithm and achieves an $O\\left( \\frac{K\\log(T)}{Δ^2} \\right)$ regret upper bound, which is the best upper bound attained so far. Nonetheless, a gap between the lower and upper bounds, ranging from $N$ to $K$, persists. It remains unclear whether the lower bound or the upper bound needs to be improved.

Existing PU methods often rely on negative-risk estimation or pseudo-labeling, which either require strong distributional assumptions or can collapse in high-dimensional settings. We propose AngularPU, a novel PU framework that operates on the unit hypersphere using cosine similarity and angular margin. In our formulation, the positive class is represented by a learnable prototype vector, and classification reduces to thresholding the cosine similarity between an embedding and this prototype-eliminating the need for explicit negative modeling. To counteract the tendency of unlabeled embeddings to cluster near the positive prototype, we introduce an angular regularizer that encourages dispersion of the unlabeled set over the hypersphere, improving separation. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Bayes-optimality of the angular decision rule, consistency of the learned prototype, and the effect of the regularizer on the unlabeled distribution. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AngularPU achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PU methods, particularly in settings with scarce positives and high-dimensional embeddings, while offering geometric interpretability and scalability."}

We introduce Small-Gain Nash (SGN), a block small-gain condition in a custom block-weighted geometry. SGN converts local curvature and cross-player Lipschitz coupling bounds into a tractable certificate of contraction. It constructs a weighted block metric in which the pseudo-gradient becomes strongly monotone on any region where these bounds hold, even when it is non-monotone in the Euclidean sense. The continuous flow is exponentially contracting in this designed geometry, and projected Euler and RK4 discretizations converge under explicit step-size bounds derived from the SGN margin and a local Lipschitz constant. Our analysis reveals a certified ``timescale band'', a non-asymptotic, metric-based certificate that plays a TTUR-like role: rather than forcing asymptotic timescale separation via vanishing, unequal step sizes, SGN identifies a finite band of relative metric weights for which a single-step-size dynamics is provably contractive. We validate the framework on quadratic games where Euclidean monotonicity analysis fails to predict convergence, but SGN successfully certifies it, and extend the construction to mirror/Fisher geometries for entropy-regularized policy gradient in Markov games. The result is an offline certification pipeline that estimates curvature, coupling, and Lipschitz parameters on compact regions, optimizes block weights to enlarge the SGN margin, and returns a structural, computable convergence certificate consisting of a metric, contraction rate, and safe step-sizes for non-monotone games."}

This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference.

It is built on two core idea: 1) Embedding vibration time series into multiple mode-wise latent feature vectors to capture diverse fault-related patterns; 2) Leveraging neural factorization principles to fuse these vectors into a unified vibration representation. This design enables effective mining of complex latent fault characteristics from raw time-series data. We further instantiate the framework with two models CP-NFC and Tucker-NFC based on CP and Tucker fusion schemes, respectively. Experimental results show that both models achieve superior diagnostic performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. The comparative analysis provides valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance for selecting effective diagnostic strategies in high-speed train bearing monitoring."}

We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a \"radical term\" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful \"Why this, and not that?\" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems."}

However, the robustness and generalization of such models are highly sensitive to input data characteristics - an aspect that remains underexplored in existing literature. This study presents a systematic empirical analysis of two key data-centric factors: input sequence length and additive noise. To support this investigation, a modular and reproducible forecasting pipeline is developed, incorporating standardized preprocessing, sequence generation, model training, validation, and evaluation. Controlled experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets with varying sampling frequencies to assess BiLSTM performance under different input conditions. The results yield three key findings: (1) longer input sequences significantly increase the risk of overfitting and data leakage, particularly in data-constrained environments; (2) additive noise consistently degrades predictive accuracy across sampling frequencies; and (3) the simultaneous presence of both factors results in the most substantial decline in model stability. While datasets with higher observation frequencies exhibit greater robustness, they remain vulnerable when both input challenges are present.

The normalized sequence is then processed by a Context Encoder that combines patch wise embeddings, positional encoding, and a Mamba enhanced Transformer layer with a mixture of experts feed forward module, allowing efficient modeling of both long range dependencies and local temporal dynamics.

However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation."}

While there has been substantial work on ensuring AI fairness, navigating trade-offs between competing notions of fairness as well as predictive accuracy remains challenging, creating barriers to the practical deployment of fair AI systems. To address this, we introduce a unifying human-centered fairness framework that systematically covers eight distinct fairness metrics, formed by combining individual and group fairness, infra-marginal and intersectional assumptions, and outcome-based and equality-of-opportunity (EOO) perspectives. This structure allows stakeholders to align fairness interventions with their values and contextual considerations. The framework uses a consistent and easy-to-understand formulation for all metrics to reduce the learning curve for non-experts. Rather than privileging a single fairness notion, the framework enables stakeholders to assign weights across multiple fairness objectives, reflecting their priorities and facilitating multi-stakeholder compromises. We apply this approach to four real-world datasets: the UCI Adult census dataset for income prediction, the COMPAS dataset for criminal recidivism, the German Credit dataset for credit risk assessment, and the MEPS dataset for healthcare utilization. We show that adjusting weights reveals nuanced trade-offs between different fairness metrics. Finally, through case studies in judicial decision-making and healthcare, we demonstrate how the framework can inform practical and value-sensitive deployment of fair AI systems."}

In this context, we first show that a classical algorithm naturally satisfies LDP and then design two new algorithms that improve it: RW-AdaBatch and RW-Meta. For RW-AdaBatch, we exploit the limited-switching behavior induced by LDP to provide a novel form of privacy amplification that grows stronger on easier data, analogous to the shuffle model in offline learning. Drawing on the theory of random walks, we prove that this improvement carries essentially no utility cost. For RW-Meta, we develop a general method for privately selecting between experts that are themselves non-trivial learning algorithms, and we show that in the context of LDP this carries no extra privacy cost. In contrast, prior work has only considered data-independent experts. We also derive formal regret bounds that scale inversely with the degree of independence between experts.

Existing NAS methods overlook useful side information from the intermediate outputs of these modules -- such as their representation quality -- limiting sample efficiency in multi-source RL settings. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven NAS pipeline that leverages language-model priors and intermediate-output signals to guide sample-efficient search for high-performing composite state encoders.

Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches.

AMUN lowers the model's confidence on forget samples by fine-tuning on their corresponding adversarial examples. Through theoretical analysis, we identify factors governing AMUN's performance, including smoothness. To facilitate training of smooth models with a controlled Lipschitz constant, we propose FastClip, a scalable method that performs layer-wise spectral-norm clipping of affine layers. In a separate study, we show that increased smoothness naturally improves adversarial example transfer, thereby supporting the second factor above.\n  Following the same principles for class unlearning, we show that existing methods fail in replicating a retrained model's behavior by introducing a nearest-neighbor membership inference attack (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities assigned to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples and demonstrate the vulnerability of such methods. We then propose a fine-tuning objective that mitigates this leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over remaining classes that a model retrained from scratch would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting(TRW) distribution serves as the desired target during fine-tuning.

We employ a self-supervised, joint-embedding pre-training stage to create an ECG representation that is enriched with contextual clinical information, while only requiring the ECG signal at inference time. Furthermore, as an indirect way to explain the model's output we train it to also predict associated laboratory abnormalities directly from the ECG embedding.

We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer.

Building on this formalism, we conduct a controlled study of three core design dimensions: masking distribution, prediction target, and encoder architecture, under rigorously controlled settings. We further employ information-theoretic measures to assess the informativeness of pretraining signals and connect them to empirically benchmarked downstream performance. Our findings reveal a surprising insight: sophisticated masking distributions offer no consistent benefit over uniform sampling for common node-level prediction tasks. Instead, the choice of prediction target and its synergy with the encoder architecture are far more critical.

In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes.

Through theoretical analysis, we identify that the gap-based methods suffer from unstable evolution, due to the potentially degenerated objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel self-play fine-tuning method, namely Self-PlAy via Noise Contrastive Estimation (SPACE), which leverages noise contrastive estimation to capture the real-world data distribution. Specifically, SPACE treats synthetic samples as auxiliary components, and discriminates them from the real ones in a binary classification manner. As a result, SPACE independently optimizes the absolute reward values for each type of data, ensuring a consistently meaningful objective and thereby avoiding the instability issue. Theoretically, we show that the optimal solution of the objective in SPACE aligns with the underlying distribution of real-world data, and SPACE guarantees a provably stable convergence to the optimal distribution. Empirically, we show that SPACE significantly improves the performance of LLMs over various tasks, and outperforms supervised fine-tuning that employs much more real-world samples. Compared to gap-based self-play fine-tuning methods, SPACE exhibits remarkable superiority and stable evolution."}

While diffusion models demonstrate exceptional performance in generation tasks, their application to TSF remains largely confined to modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the abundant cross-modal signals inherent in complex heterogeneous data. To address this gap, we propose UniDiff, a unified diffusion framework for multimodal time series forecasting. To process the numerical sequence, our framework first tokenizes the time series into patches, preserving local temporal dynamics by mapping each patch to an embedding space via a lightweight MLP. At its core lies a unified and parallel fusion module, where a single cross-attention mechanism adaptively weighs and integrates structural information from timestamps and semantic context from texts in one step, enabling a flexible and efficient interplay between modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism designed for multi-source conditioning, allowing for decoupled control over the guidance strength of textual and temporal information during inference, which significantly enhances model robustness. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed UniDiff model achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Segmenting a road network is widely recognized as the first and most critical step in developing an arrival time prediction system, particularly for auto-regressive-based approaches. Traditional methods typically employ a uniform segmentation strategy, which fails to account for varying physical constraints along roads, such as road conditions, intersections, and points of interest, thereby limiting prediction efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to efficiently and adaptively learn non-uniform road segments for arrival time prediction. Our method decouples the prediction process into two stages: 1) Non-uniform road segments are extracted based on their impact scores using the proposed RL framework; and 2) A linear prediction model is applied to the selected segments to make predictions. This method ensures optimal segment selection while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a significant improvement over traditional uniform approaches. Furthermore, our experimental results suggest that the linear approach can even achieve better performance than more complex methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which not only enhances efficiency but also improves learning performance on large-scale benchmarks.

Existing methods, focusing on aggregation or regularization, fail to address this root cause of local training bias. To this end, we propose Geometry-Guided Text Prompt Calibration (GGTPC), a novel framework that directly corrects this bias by providing clients with a global geometric prior. This prior, representing the shape of the global data distribution derived from the covariance matrix, is reconstructed on the server in a privacy-preserving manner. Clients then use a novel Geometry-Prior Calibration Layer (GPCL) to align their local feature distributions with this global prior during training. Extensive experiments show GGTPC's effectiveness. On the label-skewed CIFAR-100 dataset ($β$=0.1), it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.15\\%. Under extreme skew ($β$=0.01), it improves upon the baseline by 9.17\\%. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play module on the domain-skewed Office-Home dataset, it boosts FedAvg's performance by 4.60\\%. These results demonstrate that GGTPC effectively mitigates data heterogeneity by correcting the fundamental local training bias, serving as a versatile module to enhance various FL algorithms."}

It could be interlinked web data or citation networks of scientific publications. The essential problem for such a data type is to determine nodes that carry greater importance than all the others, a task that markedly enhances system monitoring and management. Traditional methods to identify important nodes in networks introduce centrality measures, such as node degree or more complex PageRank. However, they consider only the network structure, neglecting the rich node attributes. Recent methods adopt neural networks capable of handling node features, but they require supervision. This work addresses the identified gap--the absence of approaches that are both unsupervised and attribute-aware--by introducing a Pipeline for Important Node Exploration (PINE). At the core of the proposed framework is an attention-based graph model that incorporates node semantic features in the learning process of identifying the structural graph properties. The PINE's node importance scores leverage the obtained attention distribution. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed PINE method on various homogeneous and heterogeneous attributed networks. As an industry-implemented system, PINE tackles the real-world challenge of unsupervised identification of key entities within large-scale enterprise graphs."}

Therefore, we propose a pre-processing method IFFair based on the influence function. Compared with other fairness optimization approaches, IFFair only uses the influence disparity of training samples on different groups as a guidance to dynamically adjust the sample weights during training without modifying the network structure, data features and decision boundaries. To evaluate the validity of IFFair, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets and metrics. The experimental results show that our approach mitigates bias of multiple accepted metrics in the classification setting, including demographic parity, equalized odds, equality of opportunity and error rate parity without conflicts. It also demonstrates that IFFair achieves better trade-off between multiple utility and fairness metrics compared with previous pre-processing methods."}

It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer."}

Existing methods place all entities on one homogeneous manifold, Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic, or their product/multi-curvature variants, to model linear, symmetric, or hierarchical patterns. Yet a predefined, homogeneous manifold cannot accommodate the sharply varying curvature that real-world graphs exhibit across local regions. Since this geometry is imposed a priori, any mismatch with the knowledge graph's local curvatures will distort distances between entities and hurt the expressiveness of the resulting KGE. To rectify this, we propose RicciKGE to have the KGE loss gradient coupled with local curvatures in an extended Ricci flow such that entity embeddings co-evolve dynamically with the underlying manifold geometry towards mutual adaptation. Theoretically, when the coupling coefficient is bounded and properly selected, we rigorously prove that i) all the edge-wise curvatures decay exponentially, meaning that the manifold is driven toward the Euclidean flatness; and ii) the KGE distances strictly converge to a global optimum, which indicates that geometric flattening and embedding optimization are promoting each other. Experimental improvements on link prediction and node classification benchmarks demonstrate RicciKGE's effectiveness in adapting to heterogeneous knowledge graph structures."}

In this work, we introduce Recover-to-Forget (R2F), a novel framework for efficient unlearning in LLMs based on reconstructing full-model gradient directions from low-rank LoRA adapter updates. Rather than performing backpropagation through the full model, we compute gradients with respect to LoRA parameters using multiple paraphrased prompts and train a gradient decoder to approximate the corresponding full-model gradients. To ensure applicability to larger or black-box models, the decoder is trained on a proxy model and transferred to target models. We provide a theoretical analysis of cross-model generalization and demonstrate that our method achieves effective unlearning while preserving general model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that R2F offers a scalable and lightweight alternative for unlearning in pretrained LLMs without requiring full retraining or access to internal parameters."}

In this work, we introduce LoRA-based Unlearning with Negative Examples (LUNE), a lightweight framework that performs negative-only unlearning by updating only low-rank adapters while freezing the backbone, thereby localizing edits and avoiding disruptive global changes. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), LUNE targets intermediate representations to suppress (or replace) requested knowledge with an order-of-magnitude lower compute and memory than full fine-tuning or direct weight editing.

To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method.

We reveal a critical asymmetry in Experience Replay: while minimal buffers successfully anchor feature geometry and prevent deep forgetting, mitigating shallow forgetting typically requires substantially larger buffer capacities. To explain this, we extend the Neural Collapse framework to the sequential setting. We characterize deep forgetting as a geometric drift toward out-of-distribution subspaces and prove that any non-zero replay fraction asymptotically guarantees the retention of linear separability. Conversely, we identify that the \"strong collapse\" induced by small buffers leads to rank-deficient covariances and inflated class means, effectively blinding the classifier to true population boundaries. By unifying CL with out-of-distribution detection, our work challenges the prevailing reliance on large buffers, suggesting that explicitly correcting these statistical artifacts could unlock robust performance with minimal replay."}

Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures."}

In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We show how hypervector encoding and similarity-based classification can propagate or even amplify such biases, and we propose a fairness-aware training framework, FairGHDC, to mitigate them. FairGHDC introduces a bias correction term, derived from a gap-based demographic-parity regularizer, and converts it into a scalar fairness factor that scales the update of the class hypervector for the ground-truth label. This enables debiasing directly in the hypervector space without modifying the graph encoder or requiring backpropagation. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGHDC substantially reduces demographic-parity and equal-opportunity gaps while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard GNNs and fairness-aware GNNs.

The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics).

To address this issue, we propose a unified optimization framework based on consensus structure. This framework is not only applicable to various loss functions and combined regularization terms but can also be effectively extended to non-convex regularization terms, showing strong scalability. Based on this framework, we develop a distributed parallel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to efficiently compute CR-SVMs when data is stored in a distributed manner. To ensure the convergence of the algorithm, we also introduce the Gaussian back-substitution method. Meanwhile, for the integrity of the paper, we introduce a new model, the sparse group lasso support vector machine (SGL-SVM), and apply it to music information retrieval. Theoretical analysis confirms that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is not affected by different regularization terms and loss functions, highlighting the universality of the parallel algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and free music archiv datasets demonstrate the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the algorithm."}

Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions."}

One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training.

The Lecture here is presented in its original format, but a few remarks have been added in 2025 to reflect recent developments, and the list of references has been updated to enhance the convenience and accuracy for readers.\n  When did machine learning start? Maybe a good starting point is 1949, when Claude Shannon proposed a learning algorithm for chess-playing programs. Or maybe we should go back to the 1930s when Ronald Fisher developed discriminant analysis - a type of learning where the problem is to construct a decision rule that separates two types of vectors. Or could it be the 18th century when David Hume discussed the idea of induction? Or the 14th century, when William of Ockham formulated the principle of \"simplicity\" known as \"Ockham's razor\" (Ockham, by the way, is a small village not far from Royal Holloway). Or it may be that, like almost everything else in Western civilisation and culture, the origin of these ideas lies in the Mediterranean. After all, it was Aristotle who said that \"we learn some things only by doing things\".\n  The field of machine learning has been greatly influenced by other disciplines and the subject is in itself not a very homogeneous discipline, but includes separate, overlapping subfields. There are many parallel lines of research in ML: inductive learning, neural networks, clustering, and theories of learning. They are all part of the more general field of machine learning."}

In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect."}

However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Evaluations on a nationwide ATM transaction dataset with domain-informed anomaly injection show that WECA improves SMAPE on anomaly-affected data by 6.1 percentage points compared to a normally trained baseline, with negligible degradation on normal data.

Prior benchmarks show that machine learning and deep learning models provide only modest gains over statistical baselines, mainly due to the sparsity and heterogeneity of the DF time series. We investigate Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), large pre-trained models for generic time series, as an alternative for PMF. Using DF time series derived from real-life event logs, we compare zero-shot use of TSFMs, without additional training, with fine-tuned variants adapted on PMF-specific data. TSFMs generally achieve lower forecasting errors (MAE and RMSE) than traditional and specialized models trained from scratch on the same logs, indicating effective transfer of temporal structure from non-process domains. While fine-tuning can further improve accuracy, the gains are often small and may disappear on smaller or more complex datasets, so zero-shot use remains a strong default. Our study highlights the generalization capability and data efficiency of TSFMs for process-related time series and, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first systematic evaluation of temporal foundation models for PMF."}

On the MASK benchmark, which separates honesty from knowledge, we evaluate seven models spanning the LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral families and find that Gaussian scheduling improves honesty over no-steering and single-layer baselines in six of seven models. Equal-budget ablations on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct show the Gaussian schedule outperforms random, uniform, and box-filter depth allocations, indicating that how intervention is distributed across depth materially affects outcomes beyond total strength.

We use empirical results and theoretical analysis to substantiate this claim. In idealized experiments on empirical risk minimization, we show that SGD is drawn to parameter choices that are robust under resampling and thus avoids spurious solutions even if they lie in wider and deeper minima of the training loss. We prove rigorously that by implicitly regularizing the trace of the gradient covariance matrix, SGD controls the algorithmic variability. This regularization leads to solutions that are less sensitive to sampling noise, thereby improving generalization. Numerical experiments on neural network training show that explicitly incorporating the estimate of the algorithmic variability as a regularizer improves test performance. This fact supports our claim that bootstrap estimation underpins SGD's generalization advantages."}

Alongside performance for conditions and symptoms (for depression, anxiety ROC-AUC=0.842,0.831 ECE=0.018,0.015; core individual symptom ROC-AUC>0.74), we assess demographic fairness and investigate integration across and redundancy between different input modality types. Clinical usefulness metrics and acceptability to mental health service users are explored. When provided with sufficiently rich and large-scale multimodal data streams and specified to represent common mental conditions at the symptom rather than disorder level, such models are a principled approach for building robust assessment support tools: providing clinically-relevant outputs in a transparent and explainable format that is directly amenable to expert clinical supervision."}

Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice."}

Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities."}

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition."}

The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency. These results highlight the practicality of hardware-constrained model design for real-time IDS at the edge."}

At these scales, phonon transport follows the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), which captures non-diffusive (ballistic) effects but is too costly to solve repeatedly in inverse-design loops. Existing surrogate approaches trade speed for accuracy: fast macroscopic solvers can overestimate conductivities by hundreds of percent, while recent data-driven operator learners often require thousands of high-fidelity simulations. This creates a need for a fast, data-efficient surrogate that remains reliable across ballistic and diffusive regimes. We introduce a Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) that combines a differentiable Fourier solver with a neural generator and couples it with uncertainty-driven active learning. The Fourier solver acts as a physical inductive bias, while the network learns geometry-dependent corrections and a mixing coefficient that interpolates between macroscopic and nano-scale behavior. PEDS reduces training-data requirements by up to 70% compared with purely data-driven baselines, achieves roughly 5% fractional error with only 300 high-fidelity BTE simulations, and enables efficient design of porous geometries spanning 12-85 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ with average design errors of 4%. The learned mixing parameter recovers the ballistic-diffusive transition and improves out of distribution robustness. These results show that embedding simple, differentiable low-fidelity physics can dramatically increase surrogate data-efficiency and interpretability, making repeated PDE-constrained optimization practical for nano-scale thermal-materials design."}

To learn from this structured data, we developed a multi-modal graph neural network with a property-conditioned attention mechanism. Trained on approximately 700,000 process graphs from nearly 9,000 diverse documents, our model learns semantically rich embeddings that generalize across domains.

Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods. Our VG3T shows a notable 1.7%p improvement in mIoU while using 46% fewer primitives than the previous state-of-the-art on the nuScenes benchmark, highlighting its superior efficiency and performance."}

We generated 100 math and logic questions with verifiable answers. Six Baseline models (three current-generation, three prior-generation) answered all items. Three Predictor models then forecasted, for each question-baseline pair, if the baseline would answer correctly. Each predictor completed matched runs in two conditions: Control (simple correct/incorrect predictions) and Incentive (predictions plus wagers of 1-100,000 LLMCoin under even odds, starting from a 1,000,000 LLMCoin bankroll). Across 5,400 predictions per condition, Incentive runs showed modestly higher accuracy (81.5% vs. 79.1%, p = .089, d = 0.86) and significantly faster learning across rounds (12.0 vs. 2.9 percentage-point improvement from Round 1 to Round 4, p = .011). Most notably, stake size tracked confidence. \"Whale\" bets of 40,000+ coins were correct ~99% of the time, while small bets (<1,000 coins) showed only ~74% accuracy. The key finding is not that fictional money makes models smarter; accuracy gains were modest and did not reach statistical significance (p = .089) in this pilot. Rather, the betting mechanic created a legible confidence signal absent from binary yes/no outputs. This suggests that simple financial framing may help transform LLMs into risk-aware forecasters, making their internal beliefs visible and usable. The protocol offers a foundation for future work for meta-evaluation systems and what may become LLM-to-LLM prediction markets."}

We evaluate the model on a challenging 2D turbulent radiative layer dataset from The Well multi-physics benchmark repository and demonstrate significant improvements when compared to the single resolution baseline model, in both Variance Scaled Root Mean Squared Error and physics-driven metrics, including turbulent kinetic energy spectra and mass-temperature distributions.

A preliminary study on uncertainty quantification was performed, and we also analyzed the model's performance under different levels of abstractions of the flow, specifically on sampling subsets of field variables. We find that the absence of physical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) in the network architecture leads to degraded accuracy. A variable substitution experiment confirms that this issue persists regardless of which physical quantity is predicted directly.

We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems."}

In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible.

We apply this framework to four grounding modes (symbolic; referential; vectorial; relational) and three case studies: model-theoretic semantics achieves exact composition but lacks etiological warrant; large language models show correlational fit and local robustness for linguistic tasks, yet lack selection-for-success on world tasks without grounded interaction; human language meets the desiderata under strong authenticity through evolutionary and developmental acquisition.

However, in some image data, input features can be spatially sparse, and semantic information may occupy only a small fraction of the input pixels. In this case most computation would be wasted on empty regions. In this work, we introduce SparsePixels, a framework for efficient convolution for spatially sparse image data on FPGAs, targeting fast inference applications in constrained environments with latency requirements of microseconds or below. Our approach implements a special class of CNNs that selectively retain and compute on a small subset of pixels that are active while ignoring the rest. We show that, for example, in a neutrino physics dataset for identifying neutrino interactions in LArTPC images that have around 4k input pixels but are naturally very sparse, a standard CNN with a compact size of 4k parameters incurs an inference latency of 48.665 $μ$s on an FPGA, whereas a sparse CNN of the same base architecture computing on less than 1% of the input pixels results in a $\\times 73$ inference speedup to 0.665 $μ$s, with resource utilization well within on-chip budgets, trading only a small percent-level performance loss. At least one-order-of magnitude speedups with comparable performance are also demonstrated in similar datasets with sparse image patterns.

We discuss the two main sources of uncertainty for this prediction task, the nature of violent conflict and data limitations, embedding this in the wider literature on uncertainty quantification in machine learning. We develop a strategy to quantify uncertainty in conflict forecasting, shifting from traditional point predictions to full predictive distributions. Our approach compares and combines multiple tree-based classifiers and distributional regressors in a custom auto-ML setup, estimating distributions for each pgm individually. We also test the integration of regional models in spatial ensembles as a potential avenue to reduce uncertainty. The models are able to consistently outperform a suite of benchmarks derived from conflict history in predictions up to one year in advance, with performance driven by regions where conflict was observed. With our evaluation, we emphasize the need to understand how a metric behaves for a given prediction problem, in our case characterized by extremely high zero-inflatedness. While not resulting in better predictions, the integration of smaller models does not decrease performance for this prediction task, opening avenues to integrate data sources with less spatial coverage in the future."}

Meanwhile, despite training on vast quantities of internet video data, state-of-the-art deep learning models still fall short of human-level performance on intuitive physics benchmarks. This work investigates whether data distribution, rather than volume, is the key to learning these principles. We pretrain a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model on SAYCam, a developmentally realistic, egocentric video dataset partially capturing three children's everyday visual experiences. We find that training on this dataset, which represents 0.01% of the data volume used to train SOTA models, does not lead to significant performance improvements on the IntPhys2 benchmark. Our results suggest that merely training on a developmentally realistic dataset is insufficient for current architectures to learn representations that support intuitive physics. We conclude that varying visual data volume and distribution alone may not be sufficient for building systems with artificial intuitive physics."}

Multimodal Music Popularity Prediction via Adaptive Fusion of Modality Experts and Temporal Engagement Modeling", "categories": ["cs.SD", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": "8 pages", "summary": "Predicting a song's commercial success prior to its release remains an open and critical research challenge for the music industry. Early prediction of music popularity informs strategic decisions, creative planning, and marketing. Existing methods suffer from four limitations:(i) temporal dynamics in audio and lyrics are averaged away; (ii) lyrics are represented as a bag of words, disregarding compositional structure and affective semantics; (iii) artist- and song-level historical performance is ignored; and (iv) multimodal fusion approaches rely on simple feature concatenation, resulting in poorly aligned shared representations. To address these limitations, we introduce GAMENet, an end-to-end multimodal deep learning architecture for music popularity prediction. GAMENet integrates modality-specific experts for audio, lyrics, and social metadata through an adaptive gating mechanism. We use audio features from Music4AllOnion processed via OnionEnsembleAENet, a network of autoencoders designed for robust feature extraction; lyric embeddings derived through a large language model pipeline; and newly introduced Career Trajectory Dynamics (CTD) features that capture multi-year artist career momentum and song-level trajectory statistics. Using the Music4All dataset (113k tracks), previously explored in MIR tasks but not popularity prediction, GAMENet achieves a 12% improvement in R^2 over direct multimodal feature concatenation. Spotify audio descriptors alone yield an R^2 of 0.13. Integrating aggregate CTD features increases this to 0.69, with an additional 7% gain from temporal CTD features. We further validate robustness using the SpotGenTrack Popularity Dataset (100k tracks), achieving a 16% improvement over the previous baseline. Extensive ablations confirm the model's effectiveness and the distinct contribution of each modality."}

In the offline stage, simulation optimization is conducted across a set of covariates to approximate the optimal-solution function; in the online stage, decisions are obtained by evaluating this approximation at the observed covariate. The central theoretical challenge is to understand how the inexactness of solutions generated by simulation-optimization algorithms affects the optimality gap, which is overlooked in existing studies. To address this, we develop a unified analysis framework that explicitly accounts for both solution bias and variance. Using Polyak-Ruppert averaging SGD as an illustrative simulation-optimization algorithm, we analyze the optimality gap of OTP under four representative smoothing techniques: $k$ nearest neighbor, kernel smoothing, linear regression, and kernel ridge regression. We establish convergence rates, derive the optimal allocation of the computational budget $Γ$ between the number of design covariates and the per-covariate simulation effort, and demonstrate the convergence rate can approximately achieve $Γ^{-1}$ under appropriate smoothing technique and sample-allocation rule. Finally, through a numerical study, we validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed approach."}

Existing deep learning approaches offer empirical scalability, but provide neither interpretability nor reliability guarantees, limiting their use in scientific analysis and in applications where model outputs inform real-world decisions. Here we introduce DeepSKA, a neural framework that jointly achieves interpretability, guaranteed reliability, and substantial computational gains. DeepSKA yields mathematically transparent representations that generalise across states, times, and output functions, and it integrates this structure with a small number of stochastic simulations to produce unbiased, provably convergent, and dramatically lower-variance estimates than classical Monte Carlo. We demonstrate these capabilities across nine SRNs, including nonlinear and non-mass-action models with up to ten species, where DeepSKA delivers accurate predictions and orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvements. This interpretable and reliable neural framework offers a principled foundation for developing analogous methods for other Markovian systems, including stochastic differential equations."}

The spatio-temporal co-occurrence of extreme events can strengthen or weaken under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model spatio-temporal extremes by integrating climate indices via a conditional variational autoencoder (cXVAE). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is embedded in the decoder to convolve climatological indices with the spatial dependence within the latent space, thereby allowing the decoder to be dependent on the climate variables. There are three main contributions here. First, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed conditional XVAE accurately emulates spatial fields and recovers spatially and temporally varying extremal dependence with very low computational cost post training. Second, we provide a simple, scalable approach to detecting condition-driven shifts and whether the dependence structure is invariant to the conditioning variable. Third, when dependence is found to be condition-sensitive, the conditional XVAE supports counterfactual experiments allowing intervention on the climate covariate and propagating the associated change through the learned decoder to quantify differences in joint tail risk, co-occurrence ranges, and return metrics. To demonstrate the practical utility and performance of the model in real-world scenarios, we apply our method to analyze the monthly maximum Fire Weather Index (FWI) over eastern Australia from 2014 to 2024 conditioned on the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index."}

We introduce a controlled evaluation framework that probes reasoning reliability through four targeted stress tests: (1) rule deletion, removing either redundant or essential rules from a multi-step inference chain; (2) contradictory evidence injection; (3) logic-preserving rewrites generated through several families of equivalence laws (contrapositive, double negation, implication, De Morgan, identity, and commutativity); and (4) multi-law equivalence stacking that introduces 2-5 simultaneous logical transformations.\n  Across three representative model families: BERT, Qwen2, and LLaMA-like models. Our experiments reveal a strikingly consistent pattern: all models achieve perfect accuracy on the base tasks and remain fully generalise to redundant rule deletion and all equivalence-based rewrites (single or multi-law), but fail sharply under essential rule deletion (dropping to 25% accuracy) and collapse completely in the presence of explicit contradictions (0% accuracy). These results demonstrate that LLMs possess stable invariance to semantic-preserving logical transformations, yet remain fundamentally brittle to missing or conflicting evidence. Our framework provides a clean diagnostic tool for isolating such reasoning failure modes and highlights persistent gaps in the logical generalisation abilities of current LLMs."}

To address this issue and measure the confidence of model outputs, multiple uncertainty quantification(UQ) criteria have been proposed. However, even though important, there are limited tools to integrate these methods, hindering the practical usage of UQ methods and future research in this domain. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce UncertaintyZoo, a unified toolkit that integrates 29 uncertainty quantification methods, covering five major categories under a standardized interface. Using UncertaintyZoo, we evaluate the usefulness of existing uncertainty quantification methods under the code vulnerability detection task on CodeBERT and ChatGLM3 models. The results demonstrate that UncertaintyZoo effectively reveals prediction uncertainty.

Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs). Given its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, we expect SAR to serve as a reliable post-training method for visual autoregressive generation."}

We show that connectivity in the tails of the distribution reveals unique features of extreme events (e.g., seizures) that can help to identify their occurrence. Numerous studies have established that connectivity-based features are effective for discriminating brain states. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach: that tail connectivity provides additional discriminatory power, enabling more accurate identification of extreme-related events and improved seizure risk management. Common approaches in tail dependence modeling use pairwise summary measures or parametric models. However, these approaches do not identify channels that drive the maximal tail dependence between two groups of signals -- an information that is useful when analyzing electroencephalography of epileptic patients where specific channels are responsible for seizure occurrences. A familiar approach in traditional signal processing is canonical correlation, which we extend to the tails to develop a visualization of extremal channel-contributions. Through the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM), we develop a computationally-efficient estimator for our canonical tail dependence measure. Our method is then used for accurate frequency-based soft clustering of neonates, distinguishing those with seizures from those without."}

Using the Frobenius norm of the resulting error matrix, we derive a closed form expression for practical DNN dimensions that demonstrates the distortion is predominantly governed by the multiplier mean error (bias). To evaluate this model in realistic settings, we incorporate controlled error injection into GEMM and convolution layers and examine its effect on ImageNet scale networks. The predicted distortion correlates strongly with the observed accuracy degradation, and an error configurable AxM case study implemented on an FPGA further confirms the analytical trends.

To address this, we propose a latent variable modeling framework in which each LLM family is associated with a latent variable that captures the common underlying features in that family. An LLM's performance on different benchmarks is then driven by its latent skills, which are jointly determined by the latent variable and the model's own observable features. We develop an estimation procedure for this latent variable model and establish its statistical properties. We also design efficient numerical algorithms that support estimation and various downstream tasks.

Results confirm the effectiveness of GAGM and SEVector in enhancing feature discriminability and reducing false negatives, particularly for malignant cases. In our experiments, however, the Feature Smoothing Loss did not yield measurable improvements under mammography classification conditions, suggesting that its effectiveness may depend on specific architectural and computational assumptions. Beyond validation, our contribution extends the original framework through multi metric evaluation (macro F1, per class recall variance, ROC/AUC), feature interpretability analysis (Grad CAM), and the development of an interactive dashboard for clinical exploration. As a perspective, we highlight the need to explore alternative approaches to improve intra class compactness and inter class separability, with the specific goal of enhancing the distinction between malignant and benign cases in mammography classification."}

We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity.

However, FL encounters critical challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data from diverse driving environments. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Federated Deep Supervision and Regularization (FedDSR), a paradigm that incorporates multi-access intermediate layer supervision and regularization within federated AD system. Specifically, FedDSR comprises following integral strategies: (I) to select multiple intermediate layers based on predefined architecture-agnostic standards. (II) to compute mutual information (MI) and negative entropy (NE) on those selected layers to serve as intermediate loss and regularizer. These terms are integrated into the output-layer loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. (III) to aggregate models from vehicles trained based on aforementioned rules of (I) and (II) to generate the global model on central server. By guiding and penalizing the learning of feature representations at intermediate stages, FedDSR enhances the model generalization and accelerates model convergence for federated AD. We then take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess FedDSR and apply FedDSR to multiple model architectures and FL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDSR achieves up to 8.93% improvement in mIoU and 28.57% reduction in training rounds, compared to other FL baselines, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in federated AD ecosystems."}

We introduce Learning While Evaluating (LWE), a framework that allows evaluators to improve sequentially at inference time without requiring training or validation sets. LWE maintains an evolving meta-prompt that (i) produces sample-specific evaluation instructions and (ii) refines itself through self-generated feedback. Furthermore, we propose Selective LWE, which updates the meta-prompt only on self-inconsistent cases, focusing computation where it matters most. This selective approach retains the benefits of sequential learning while being far more cost-effective. Across two pairwise comparison benchmarks, Selective LWE outperforms strong baselines, empirically demonstrating that evaluators can improve during sequential testing with a simple selective update, learning most from the cases they struggle with."}

However, fine-tuning VLMs in few-shot scenarios poses significant challenges in balancing task-specific adaptation and generalization in the obtained model. Meanwhile, current researches have predominantly focused on prompt-based adaptation methods, leaving adapter-based approaches underexplored and revealing notable performance gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics."}

To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component. High-scoring regions form the final lytic or blastic segmentation. On held-out radiologist annotations, we achieve strong blastic/lytic performance despite no mask supervision (F1: 0.91/0.85; Dice: 0.87/0.78), exceeding baselines (F1: 0.79/0.67; Dice: 0.74/0.55).

Many modern web applications operate on web APIs (e.g., RESTful, SOAP, and WebSockets), their exposure invites intended attacks or unintended illegal visits, causing abnormal system behaviors. However, such anomalies can share very similar logs with normal logs, missing crucial information (which could be in database) for log discrimination. Further, log instances can be also noisy, which can further mislead the state-of-the-art log learning solutions to learn spurious correlation, resulting superficial models and rules for anomaly detection. In this work, we propose MINES which infers explainable API invariants for anomaly detection from the schema level instead of detailed raw log instances, which can (1) significantly discriminate noise in logs to identify precise normalities and (2) detect abnormal behaviors beyond the instrumented logs. Technically, MINES (1) converts API signatures into table schema to enhance the original database shema; and (2) infers the potential database constraints on the enhanced database schema to capture the potential relationships between APIs and database tables. MINES uses LLM for extracting potential relationship based on two given table structures; and use normal log instances to reject and accept LLM-generated invariants. Finally, MINES translates the inferred constraints into invariants to generate Python code for verifying the runtime logs. We extensively evaluate MINES on web-tamper attacks on the benchmarks of TrainTicket, NiceFish, Gitea, Mastodon, and NextCloud against baselines such as LogRobust, LogFormer, and WebNorm.

This combination yields a unique and well-defined so-called least-squares reward consistent with the expert policy. We model the expert demonstrations as a Markov chain with the invariant distribution defined by an unknown expert policy $π^\\star$ and estimate the policy by a penalized maximum-likelihood procedure over a class of conditional distributions on the action space. We establish high-probability bounds for the excess Kullback--Leibler divergence between the estimated policy and the expert policy, accounting for statistical complexity through covering numbers of the policy class.

Three neural networks-InitNet, RefNet, and an extended BarrierNet-collaborate to generate reference inputs and adapt constraint-related hyperparameters automatically over time and across initial conditions, reducing conservativeness while maximizing robustness. The resulting controller achieves STL satisfaction with strictly feasible dQPs and requires no manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains high STL robustness under tight input bounds and significantly outperforms fixed-parameter and non-adaptive baselines in complex environments."}

Our proposed method replaces the random masking augmentation used in most masked image modelling pretraining methods. The proposed selective masking method selectively masks image patches with the highest reconstruction loss by breaking the image reconstruction pretraining into iterative steps to leverage the trained model's knowledge. We show on two general datasets (Pascal VOC and Cityscapes) and two weed segmentation datasets (Nassar 2020 and Sugarbeets 2016) that our proposed selective masking method outperforms the traditional random masking method and supervised ImageNet pretraining on downstream segmentation accuracy by 2.9% for general datasets and 2.5% for weed segmentation datasets. Furthermore, we found that our selective masking method significantly improves accuracy for the lowest-performing classes. Lastly, we show that using the same pretraining and downstream dataset yields the best result for low-budget self-supervised pretraining. Our proposed Selective Masking Image Reconstruction method provides an effective and practical solution to improve end-to-end semantic segmentation workflows, especially for scenarios that require limited model capacity to meet inference speed and computational resource requirements."}

In this work, we investigate the effective memory span of transformer-based world models through an analysis of several memory augmentation mechanisms. We introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes between memory encoding and memory injection mechanisms, motivating their roles in extending the world model's memory through the lens of residual stream dynamics. Using a state recall evaluation task, we measure the memory recall of each mechanism and analyze its respective trade-offs. Our findings show that memory mechanisms improve the effective memory span in vision transformers and provide a path to completing loop closures within a world model's imagination."}

There are many Machine Learning (ML) models designed to analyze and detect network attacks, especially using supervised models. However, these models are designed to classify samples (normal and attacks) based on the patterns they learn during the training phase, so they perform inefficiently on unseen attacks. This research addresses this issue by evaluating five different supervised models to assess their performance and execution time in predicting zero-day attacks and find out which model performs accurately and quickly. The goal is to improve the performance of these supervised models by not only proposing a framework that applies grid search, dimensionality reduction and oversampling methods to overcome the imbalance problem, but also comparing the effectiveness of oversampling on ml model metrics, in particular the accuracy. To emulate attack detection in real life, this research applies a highly imbalanced data set and only exposes the classifiers to zero-day attacks during the testing phase, so the models are not trained to flag the zero-day attacks. Our results show that Random Forest (RF) performs best under both oversampling and non-oversampling conditions, this increased effectiveness comes at the cost of longer processing times. Therefore, we selected XG Boost (XGB) as the top model due to its fast and highly accurate performance in detecting zero-day attacks."}

In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models.

We frame the design goal of watermarking schemes as faithful representation of ideal attribution mechanisms. This novel perspective brings conceptual clarity, replacing piecemeal probabilistic statements with a unified language for stating the guarantees of each scheme. It also enables precise reasoning about desiderata for future watermarking schemes, even when no current construction achieves them, since the ideal functionalities are specified first. In this way, the framework provides a roadmap that clarifies which guarantees are attainable in an idealized setting and worth pursuing in practice."}

These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection."}

As their computational requirements continue to grow, these models are increasingly deployed as cloud-based services, allowing users to access powerful LLMs via the Internet. However, this deployment model introduces a new class of threat: denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via unbounded reasoning, where adversaries craft specially designed inputs that cause the model to enter excessively long or infinite generation loops. These attacks can exhaust backend compute resources, degrading or denying service to legitimate users. To mitigate such risks, many LLM providers adopt a closed-source, black-box setting to obscure model internals. In this paper, we propose ThinkTrap, a novel input-space optimization framework for DoS attacks against LLM services even in black-box environments. The core idea of ThinkTrap is to first map discrete tokens into a continuous embedding space, then undertake efficient black-box optimization in a low-dimensional subspace exploiting input sparsity. The goal of this optimization is to identify adversarial prompts that induce extended or non-terminating generation across several state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving DoS with minimal token overhead. We evaluate the proposed attack across multiple commercial, closed-source LLM services. Our results demonstrate that, even far under the restrictive request frequency limits commonly enforced by these platforms, typically capped at ten requests per minute (10 RPM), the attack can degrade service throughput to as low as 1% of its original capacity, and in some cases, induce complete service failure."}

Our curriculum analysis reveals 35.3% of tasks exhibit low neural affinity for Transformers--a distributional bias mirroring ARC-AGI-2. To probe this misalignment, we fine-tuned a 1.7M-parameter Transformer across 302 tasks, revealing a profound Compositional Gap: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%) achieve >80% cell accuracy (local patterns) but <10% grid accuracy (global synthesis). This provides direct evidence for a Neural Affinity Ceiling Effect, where performance is bounded by architectural suitability, not curriculum.

These efficiently computable structural features derive from constrained graph colorings where each triangle uses exactly two colors, forbidding monochromatic and rainbow triangles, a constraint arising in distributed systems where components avoid complete concentration or isolation. For theta graphs Theta_n, we prove r_k(Theta_n) = S(n-2, k-1) for k >= 3 (Stirling numbers of the second kind) and r_2(Theta_n) = 2^(n-2) + 1, computable in O(n) time.

Among various XAI approaches, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has gained prominence due to its ability to provide both global and local explanations across different machine learning models. While SHAP effectively visualizes feature importance, it often lacks contextual explanations that are meaningful for end-users, especially those without technical backgrounds. To address this gap, we propose a Python package that extends SHAP by integrating it with a large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT, to generate contextualized textual explanations. This integration is guided by user-defined parameters (such as feature aliases, descriptions, and additional background) to tailor the explanation to both the model context and the user perspective. We hypothesize that this enhancement can improve the perceived understandability of SHAP explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed package, we applied it in a healthcare-related case study and conducted user evaluations involving real end-users. The results, based on Likert-scale surveys and follow-up interviews, indicate that the generated explanations were perceived as more understandable and contextually appropriate compared to visual-only outputs. While the findings are preliminary, they suggest that combining visualization with contextualized text may support more user-friendly and trustworthy model explanations."}

However, existing approaches typically treat observations as high-level conditioning inputs to the denoising network, rather than integrating them into the stochastic dynamics of the diffusion process itself. As a result, sampling must begin from random Gaussian noise, weakening the coupling between perception and control and often yielding suboptimal performance. We introduce BridgePolicy, a generative visuomotor policy that explicitly embeds observations within the stochastic differential equation via a diffusion-bridge formulation. By constructing an observation-informed trajectory, BridgePolicy enables sampling to start from a rich, informative prior rather than random noise, substantially improving precision and reliability in control. A key challenge is that classical diffusion bridges connect distributions with matched dimensionality, whereas robotic observations are heterogeneous and multi-modal and do not naturally align with the action space. To address this, we design a multi-modal fusion module and a semantic aligner that unify visual and state inputs and align observation and action representations, making the bridge applicable to heterogeneous robot data. Extensive experiments across 52 simulation tasks on three benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate that BridgePolicy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative policies."}

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of how to effectively leverage multimodal signals across both stages of the two-stage lifelong modeling framework. Our key insight is that simplicity suffices in the GSU: lightweight cosine similarity with high-quality multimodal embeddings outperforms complex retrieval mechanisms.

However, temporal reasoning, particularly under complex temporal constraints, remains a major challenge. To this end, existing approaches have explored symbolic methods, which encode temporal structure explicitly, and reflective mechanisms, which revise reasoning errors through multi-step inference. Nonetheless, symbolic approaches often underutilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while reflective methods typically lack structured temporal representations, which can result in inconsistent or hallucinated reasoning. As a result, even when the correct temporal context is available, LLMs may still misinterpret or misapply time-related information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning (NeSTR), a novel framework that integrates structured symbolic representations with hybrid reflective reasoning to enhance the temporal sensitivity of LLM inference. NeSTR preserves explicit temporal relations through symbolic encoding, enforces logical consistency via verification, and corrects flawed inferences using abductive reflection. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal question answering benchmarks demonstrate that NeSTR achieves superior zero-shot performance and consistently improves temporal reasoning without any fine-tuning, showcasing the advantage of neuro-symbolic integration in enhancing temporal understanding in large language models."}

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician\" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \\textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models."}

Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories."}

However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."}

While recent continuous relaxation approaches impose acyclicity through smooth constraint functions involving powers of the adjacency matrix, they lead to non-convex optimization problems that are challenging to solve. In contrast, we assume that the underlying DAG has only non-negative edge weights, and leverage this additional structure to impose acyclicity via a convex constraint. This enables us to cast the problem of non-negative DAG recovery from multivariate time-series data as a convex optimization problem in abstract form, which we solve using the method of multipliers. Crucially, the convex formulation guarantees global optimality of the solution. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed method on synthetic time-series data, where it outperforms existing alternatives."}

We train a multi-layer perceptron to map noisy measurement vectors to binary defect indicators, achieving accurate and robust recovery even under sparse, bounded perturbations.

This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry.

We allow for the inclusion of covariate information specific to the occurrence and reporting periods as well as characteristics related to the entity for which events occurred. We demonstrate how the maximisation step and the information flow between EM iterations can be tailored to leverage the predictive power of neural networks and (extreme) gradient boosting machines (XGBoost). With simulation experiments, we show that we can effectively model both the occurrence and reporting of events when dealing with high-dimensional covariate information. In the presence of non-linear effects, we show that our methodology outperforms existing EM-based nowcasting frameworks that use generalised linear models in the maximisation step.

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.\n  To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines.

Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms.

Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code."}

However, while many deep learning models excel at this task, their high computational requirements often limit their practical application in real-time monitoring systems. To address this limitation, a lightweight model based on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is proposed for microseismic event classification, leveraging its inherent resolution-invariance and computational efficiency for waveform processing. In the STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD), a global and large-scale database of seismic waveforms, the FNO-based model demonstrates high effectiveness for trigger classification, with an F1 score of 95% even in the scenario of data sparsity in training. The new FNO model greatly decreases the computer power needed relative to current deep learning models without sacrificing the classification success rate measured by the F1 score. A test on a real microseismic dataset shows a classification success rate with an F1 score of 98%, outperforming many traditional deep-learning techniques. A combination of high success rate and low computational power indicates that the FNO model can serve as a methodology of choice for real-time monitoring of microseismicity for induced seismicity. The method saves computational resources and facilitates both post-processing and real-time seismic processing suitable for the implementation of traffic light systems to prevent undesired induced seismicity."}

In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences.

However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the \"Memory Trap\". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance.

Existing methods for graph estimation for such data are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar time series with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data."}

All previous methods tend to scale up the model parameters during training time. However, how to efficiently utilize and scale up computational resources during test time remains underexplored, which can prove to be a scaling-efficient approach and bring orthogonal improvements in LM domains. The key point in applying test-time scaling to DLRS lies in effectively generating diverse yet meaningful outputs for the same instance. We propose two ways: One is to explore the heterogeneity of different model architectures. The other is to utilize the randomness of model initialization under a homogeneous architecture. The evaluation is conducted across eight models, including both classic and SOTA models, on three benchmarks. Sufficient evidence proves the effectiveness of both solutions. We further prove that under the same inference budget, test-time scaling can outperform parameter scaling.

This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient.

In the fields of atmospheric science and environmental monitoring, estimating emission source locations is a central task that further relies on multiple model parameters that dictate velocity profiles and diffusion parameters. Estimating these parameters at the same time as emission sources from scarce data is a difficult task. In this work, we achieve this by leveraging the flexibility and generality of PINNs. We use a weighted adaptive method based on the neural tangent kernels to solve a source inversion problem with parameter estimation on the 2D and 3D advection-diffusion equations with unknown velocity and diffusion coefficients that may vary in space and time. Our proposed weighted adaptive method is presented as an extension of PINNs for forward PDE problems to a highly ill-posed source inversion and parameter estimation problem. The key idea behind our methodology is to attempt the joint recovery of the solution, the sources along with the unknown parameters, thereby using the underlying partial differential equation as a constraint that couples multiple unknown functional parameters, leading to more efficient use of the limited information in the measurements. We present various numerical experiments, using different types of measurements that model practical engineering systems, to show that our proposed method is indeed successful and robust to additional noise in the measurements."}

To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability.

Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability.

We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing."}
