In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language.

However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

On one hand, low-latency code completion offers\ncompletion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current\nposition. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex\nmodifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in\nnatural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This\ncreates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts\nthe developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap\nand provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next\nEdit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent\ninteraction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent\nedit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and\nan evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct\nsupervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive\nevaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding\nseveral novel findings.

We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,\n{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically\nmisaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test\nfor arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed\nprompt.

A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can\nbe viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine\ndialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure\nthe semantic divergence between prompts and responses.

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the\nacceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the\nVBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from\n0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further\ncorroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

However, the\ncomputationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation\nmodels (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of\nexoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning\n(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of\narbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.\nA new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type\nhost stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network\n(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to\npredict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To\nensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,\nHATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all\ntargets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the\ntwo ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are\nto such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but\none planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.\nThe developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature\nfield of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to\nM-type host stars.

We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines.
