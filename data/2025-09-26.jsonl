In\nthis paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that\nminimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting\napproximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by\napproximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid\nfunctions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full\nretraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)\nthat identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder\nallocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework\nthat continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via\ngradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art\nupdatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that\nSig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,\nand uses up to 1000x less memory."}

Unlike prior public\ncoding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem\ngenerators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel\nstrategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments\nreveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with\nnear-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To\nenable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key\ntraining ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience\nreplay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,\nwe use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,\ncompositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.\nResults show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but\npersistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean\ntestbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how\nmodels can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills."}

Predictive models should also be able to\nreliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with\nconfidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing\napproaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,\nrelying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions\noverlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in\ncalibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more\nprincipled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to\nthe current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test\ntime/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended\nobjective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),\nwhich combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware\ncalibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without\nprior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard\nbenchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical\ndomain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in\nreducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches."}

Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end\nneural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large\nVLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical\ndeployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation\npolicy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we\npropose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for\nrobotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a\nneural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action\nrepresentation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action\nrepresentation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified\nmanner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to\nobjects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter\naccuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,\nmulti-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and\nhardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal\n$\\widetilde{O}(d \\log n)$ query algorithm is known due to\nHopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted\nthe power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in\nfact without this power there is an $\\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to\nDasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).\n  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning\nhalfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound,\nwe consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size\n$D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain\nan optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned\nhalfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$.\nIn fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean\nfunction $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$\nprovided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these\norderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each\nordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.\n  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal\nalgorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\\min(D + \\log(1/\\varepsilon),\n1/\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error\n$\\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a\n$c\\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This\nbound is optimal up to a $\\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting."}

Clinical\ndecision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple\noptions, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are\ntypically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We\npropose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:\nprompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an\nMRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:\nchoice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train\nand evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT\nincentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We\npropose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and\nconduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models\ngeneralize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust\nacross multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with\nmultiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the\nbenchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches\nfor enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists.

We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into\ninterpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and\nbuild practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more\nrobust against Gaussian noise."}

We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the\nbenefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL\nstages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation\nand scheduling for reward, and stream-based training.
