This underrepresentation is revealed in\nthis study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark\ndifferences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the\nconventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS\ntrajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for\nindividuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal\nembeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to\ncapture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent\nbiases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the\ngenerated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from\nLos Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics).

To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial.

Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model.

This ensures that our\nmodels make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to\nbecome more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural\narchitecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This\nsection explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention\nincreases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we\nexplore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage\nthese properties to better distill model knowledge.\n  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures\ncan increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to\nbecome smaller, faster, and cheaper."}

Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial\nquestion-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,\nPhi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual\ninaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%\nimprovement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance\ncompared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having\nonly 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%\ndrop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to\nOpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing\nfactual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a\ngeneralizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of\nlarge language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

A promising direction for obtaining\nconditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing\nheteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density\n$\\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this\nvein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,\ntypically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,\nwe observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the\ncase of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly\nconformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a\nnumber of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how\nto construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets\nas partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal\nsets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results\nindicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely\napproximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to\nalternative methods."}

As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,\nit forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii\ntype, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on\nWasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding\n(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution\nto the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by\nTrevisan's superposition principle.

Our\nframework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*\nutility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,\nlow-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility\nPreservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict\nweight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,\nwhich merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience\nand impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended\nsettings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether\nan arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by\nreduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable\nisland'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and\nverified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.\nConsequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage\nand generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality\nrather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation\nguidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems."}

This paper presents a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for\nmobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with\ncontinuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve\nas the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that\nintegrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the\nassociated overhead related to HOs.

Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)\noutperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code\ngeneration and fault detection.\n  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- \"invisible hands\"\nsuch as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM\nreproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.\n  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by\ndeliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the\nprompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large\nlocalization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because\nany offset should divert the model from the original fix.\n  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans\nbenchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.\nA first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the\nresult with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests.
