However, many of these methods rely on rigid heuristics that fail to generalize across tasks and modalities. Here, we propose a novel framework for UQ that is highly flexible and approaches or surpasses the performance of prior heuristic methods. We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains. We present a framework for the wider potential of DCU and its implications for integration into UQ for multi-modal and agentic frameworks."}

This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics.

This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\\% and 4.5\\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time. Because the framework assumes only a suitable assay and defined formulation space, it can be adapted to different CPA libraries, objective definitions, and cell lines to accelerate cryopreservation development."}

We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \\in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest.

However, these models are often limited by long-term instabilities, climatological drift, and substantial computational costs during training and inference, restricting their broader application for climate studies. Addressing these limitations, Guan et al. (2024) introduced LUCIE, a lightweight, physically consistent climate emulator utilizing a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture. This model is able to reproduce accurate long-term statistics including climatological mean and seasonal variability. However, LUCIE's native resolution (~300 km) is inadequate for detailed regional impact assessments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a deep learning-based downscaling framework, leveraging probabilistic diffusion-based generative models with conditional and posterior sampling frameworks. These models downscale coarse LUCIE outputs to 25 km resolution. They are trained on approximately 14,000 ERA5 timesteps spanning 2000-2009 and evaluated on LUCIE predictions from 2010 to 2020. Model performance is assessed through diverse metrics, including latitude-averaged RMSE, power spectrum, probability density functions and First Empirical Orthogonal Function of the zonal wind. We observe that the proposed approach is able to preserve the coarse-grained dynamics from LUCIE while generating fine-scaled climatological statistics at ~28km resolution."}

Language is increasingly modeled in curved geometries - hyperbolic spaces for hierarchy, mixed-curvature manifolds for compositional structure - yet a basic scientific question remains unresolved: what does curvature mean for text itself, in a way that is native to language rather than an artifact of the embedding space we choose? We argue that text does indeed have curvature, and show how to detect it, define it, and use it. To this end, we propose Texture, a text-native, word-level discrete curvature signal, and make three contributions. (a) Existence: We provide empirical and theoretical certificates that semantic inference in natural corpora is non-flat, i.e. language has inherent curvature. (b) Definition: We define Texture by reconciling left- and right-context beliefs around a masked word through a Schrodinger bridge, yielding a curvature field that is positive where context focuses meaning and negative where it fans out into competing continuations. (c) Utility: Texture is actionable: it serves as a general-purpose measurement and control primitive enabling geometry without geometric training; we instantiate it on two representative tasks, improving long-context inference through curvature-guided compression and retrieval-augmented generation through curvature-guided routing. Together, our results establish a text-native curvature paradigm, making curvature measurable and practically useful."}

Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms."}

These subsystems are often interdependent, making it important to understand how temporal patterns at one subsystem relate to others. This is challenging in decentralized settings where raw measurements cannot be shared and client observations are heterogeneous. In practical deployments each subsystem (client) operates a fixed proprietary model that cannot be modified or retrained, limiting existing approaches. Nonlinear dynamics further make cross client temporal interdependencies difficult to interpret because they are embedded in nonlinear state transition functions. We present a federated framework for learning temporal interdependencies across clients under these constraints. Each client maps high dimensional local observations to low dimensional latent states using a nonlinear state space model. A central server learns a graph structured neural state transition model over the communicated latent states using a Graph Attention Network. For interpretability we relate the Jacobian of the learned server side transition model to attention coefficients, providing the first interpretable characterization of cross client temporal interdependencies in decentralized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees to a centralized oracle and validate the framework through synthetic experiments demonstrating convergence, interpretability, scalability and privacy. Additional real world experiments show performance comparable to decentralized baselines."}

We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines."}

TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness."}

We introduce and study $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints."}

First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models."}

To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners. Empirical experiments validate QuaRK and illustrate the predicted interpolation and generalization behaviours on synthetic beta-mixing time series tasks."}

Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks."}

Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \\textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain. We demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing TSC work in locating unusual evolving patterns through extensive empirical evaluations. We further demonstrate the utility of our work with a real-life manufacturing application from Intel.

Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance."}

However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates.

We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes.

Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy.

Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance. We present ablation studies evaluating each constraint alone and jointly across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant models, and Contiformers. Continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time series; the Contiformer architecture, which provides both, outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To mitigate data scarcity, we generate synthetic datasets using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) with time-series conditional GANs, producing realistic, temporally consistent magnetic sequences across varied trajectories and environments.

To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization.

We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints.

This creates a severe scalability bottleneck that fails to meet the high-efficiency requirements of real-time stream processing. To break this impasse, we propose Memory for Time Series (MEMTS), a lightweight and plug-and-play method for retrieval-free domain adaptation in time series forecasting. The key component of MEMTS is a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM), which internalizes domain-specific temporal dynamics, such as recurring seasonal patterns and trends into a compact set of learnable latent prototypes. In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations. This paradigm shift enables MEMTS to achieve accurate domain adaptation with constant-time inference and near-zero latency, while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general temporal patterns, all without requiring any architectural modifications to the frozen TSFM backbone.

In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1.

However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that AnomaMind consistently improves anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AnomaMind."}

While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness. Empirically, our MVP achieves state-of-the-art success rates across several challenging robotic manipulation tasks from Robomimic and OGBench. It also delivers substantial improvements in training and inference speed over existing flow-based policy baselines."}

Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible."}

Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.\n  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector."}

It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization."}

Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny."}

Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS.

This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting."}

We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale."}

In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement."}

In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training."}

For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $α\\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $α$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $α$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $α^{1/2}\\log(1/α)$ for small $α$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $α$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives. We identify a non-Gaussian (Gibbs) limiting law under the correct scaling, which is validated numerically, and provide a corresponding pre-limit Wasserstein error bound."}

Against these issues, we introduce KoopGen, a generator-based neural Koopman framework that models dynamics through a structured, state-dependent representation of Koopman generators. By exploiting the intrinsic Cartesian decomposition into skew-adjoint and self-adjoint components, KoopGen separates conservative transport from irreversible dissipation while enforcing exact operator-theoretic constraints during learning.

In particular, instead of selecting position indices from a predefined discrete set, RFS uses randomly sampled continuous values, thereby avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) issues on unseen lengths by exposing the model to diverse indices during training. Since assigning indices to tokens is a common and fundamental procedure in widely used PEs, the advantage of RFS can easily be incorporated into, for instance, the absolute sinusoidal encoding, RoPE, and ALiBi.

However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models."}

To resolve ill-posedness, we extend the semi-dual framework via a Gaussian smoothing strategy based on Brownian motion. Our primary theoretical contribution proves that under a regular source measure, the formulation is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map. Furthermore, we establish a sharp characterization for the regularity of smoothed measures, proving that the success of smoothing depends strictly on the kernel of the covariance operator. Empirical results on synthetic functional data and time-series datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses spurious solutions and outperforms existing baselines."}

Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only $9\\%$ of true features despite achieving $71\\%$ explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms."}

Our empirical analysis reveals that while activation magnitude correlates moderately with directional consistency, the variance in magnitude is significant and often disproportionate to semantic quality. This suggests that high-magnitude activations risk dominating the global steering direction if not properly normalized. To address this, ROAST employs grouped normalization to balance contributions across samples, ensuring a more robust estimation of the consensus steering direction. Across models (0.6B to 32B), ROAST consistently improves performance on diverse tasks (e.g., +9.7% on GSM8K for Qwen3-0.6B and +12.1% on TruthfulQA for GLM4-32B), and analyses show that CSS better preserves activation energy."}

In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization. Both losses are orthogonal to the standard load-balancing loss and compatible with both the shared-expert architecture in DeepSeekMoE and vanilla top-$k$ MoE architectures. We implement both losses as a drop-in Megatron-LM module. Extensive experiments across pre-training, fine-tuning, and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate consistent task gains, higher expert specialization, and lower-entropy routing; together, these improvements translate into faster inference via more stable expert pathways."}

As agents increasingly process untrusted data from emails, documents, tool outputs, and external APIs, robust attack detection becomes essential.

We present a comprehensive analysis using a diverse benchmark of 18 datasets spanning harmful requests, jailbreaks, indirect prompt injections, and extraction attacks. We propose Leave-One-Dataset-Out (LODO) evaluation to measure true out-of-distribution generalization, revealing that the standard practice of train-test splits from the same dataset sources severely overestimates performance: aggregate metrics show an 8.4 percentage point AUC inflation, but per-dataset gaps range from 1% to 25% accuracy-exposing heterogeneous failure modes. To understand why classifiers fail to generalize, we analyze Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) feature coefficients across LODO folds, finding that 28% of top features are dataset-dependent shortcuts whose class signal depends on specific dataset compositions rather than semantic content. We systematically compare production guardrails (PromptGuard 2, LlamaGuard) and LLM-as-judge approaches on our benchmark, finding all three fail on indirect attacks targeting agents (7-37% detection) and that PromptGuard 2 and LlamaGuard cannot evaluate agentic tool injection due to architectural limitations. Finally, we show that LODO-stable SAE features provide more reliable explanations for classifier decisions by filtering dataset artifacts.

Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates.

However, long-context retrieval remains a major limitation: existing models are typically trained and evaluated on short sequences, while real-world time-series sensor streams can span millions of datapoints. This mismatch requires precise temporal localization under strict computational constraints, a regime that is not captured by current benchmarks. We introduce TS-Haystack, a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark comprising ten task types across four categories: direct retrieval, temporal reasoning, multi-step reasoning and contextual anomaly. The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity."}

Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines."}

This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines.

Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns. Experiments show that RMB-CLE recovers ground-truth clusters in synthetic data and consistently outperforms multi-task, single-task, and pooling-based ensemble methods across diverse real-world and synthetic benchmarks.

By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017.

We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity. Across three real-world opinion datasets, our method consistently improves population-level response prediction under constrained budgets, including a >12% relative gain on CES at a 10% respondent budget."}

Unlike conventional pipelines that treat ML inference as a static preprocessing step, MLAT positions the model as a first-class tool alongside web search, database queries, and APIs, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use it based on conversational context.\n  To validate MLAT, we present PitchCraft, a pilot production system that converts discovery call recordings into professional proposals with ML-predicted pricing. The system uses two agents: a Research Agent that gathers prospect intelligence via parallel tool calls, and a Draft Agent that invokes an XGBoost pricing model as a tool call and generates a complete proposal through structured outputs. The pricing model, trained on 70 examples combining real and human-verified synthetic data, achieves R^2 = 0.807 on held-out data with a mean absolute error of 3688 USD.

However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%."}

To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps.

Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average. Despite the substantial reduction in compute, AERO matches or improves Pass@8 and Avg@8 over GRPO, demonstrating a practical, scalable, and compute-efficient strategy for RL-based LLM alignment."}

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap."}

Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of \"importance\" and \"relevance\" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data.

Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency."}

In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block.

We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed.

To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets."}

This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \\emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms.

Our analysis shows SOAR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left({σ^*}^2\\sum_{i=2}^K \\frac{\\log T}{Δ_i} + \\sqrt{K \\sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2}\\right)$, up to preprocessing costs depending only on problem parameters, where ${σ^*}^2 := \\min_j σ_j^2$ is the minimum source variance and $Δ_i$ denotes the suboptimality gap of the $i$-th arm. This result is both surprising as despite lacking prior knowledge of the minimum-variance source among $M$ alternatives, SOAR attains the optimal instance-dependent regret of standard single-source MAB with variance ${σ^*}^2$, while incurring only an small (and unavoidable) additive cost of $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{K \\sum_{j=1}^M σ_j^2})$ towards the optimal (minimum variance) source identification. Our theoretical bounds represent a significant improvement over some proposed baselines, e.g. Uniform UCB or Explore-then-Commit UCB, which could potentially suffer regret scaling with $σ_{\\max}^2$ in place of ${σ^*}^2$-a gap that can be arbitrarily large when $σ_{\\max} \\gg σ^*$.

To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities.

To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations.

While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing."}

Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm.

We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay.

Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results."}

As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds.

The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility. The merge preserves numerical fidelity (mean gap about 0.03 percentage points) and recovers about 1.91x evaluation throughput.

These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement.

For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation."}

In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO.

We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup."}

In this paper, we show how it is possible to circumvent these limitations by constructing formally-verified neural network solvers for PDEs, with rigorous convergence, stability, and conservation properties, whose correctness can therefore be guaranteed even in extrapolatory regimes. By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way.

To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO.

Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains.

Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \\emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\\mathbf{w}$ by $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler."}

However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs."}

In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees.

To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods.

Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step.

We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise."}

Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues.

We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring."}

We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \\log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss."}

We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation."}

We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models."}

In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."}

This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents.

We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model.

Moreover, existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dynamic wireless environments with imperfect knowledge of passive eavesdroppers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid quantum proximal policy optimization (Q-PPO) framework for SIM-assisted secure communications, which jointly optimizes transmit power allocation and SIM phase shifts to maximize the average secrecy rate under power and quality-of-service constraints. Specifically, a parameterized quantum circuit is embedded into the actor network, forming a hybrid classical-quantum policy architecture that enhances policy representation capability and exploration efficiency in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-PPO scheme consistently outperforms DRL baselines, achieving approximately 15% higher secrecy rates and 30% faster convergence under imperfect eavesdropper channel state information.

Notably, cutting-edge protein-centric models such as Boltz now operate at atom-level granularity for protein-ligand co-folding, yet their atom-level expressiveness for small-molecule tasks remains unexplored. A key open question is whether these protein co-folding models capture transferable chemical physics or rely on protein evolutionary signals, which would limit their utility for small-molecule tasks. In this work, we investigate the quality of Boltz atom-level representations across diverse small-molecule benchmarks. Our results show that Boltz is competitive with specialized baselines on ADMET property prediction tasks and effective for molecular generation and optimization. These findings suggest that the representational capacity of cutting-edge protein-centric models has been underexplored and position Boltz as a strong baseline for atom-level representation learning for small molecules."}

Second, a novel mathematical discretization of morality and a demonstration of its real-life application have been conveyed and tested against other techniques on two datasets.

The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score.

Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP.

They include univariate time series, synthetic multivariate workloads, and real-world production telemetry with over 100,000 features.\n  We use a unified training and evaluation pipeline across all datasets. The evaluation includes NAB-style metrics to capture early detection behaviour for datasets where anomalies persist over contiguous time intervals. This enables window-based scoring in settings where anomalies occur over contiguous time intervals, even when labels are recorded at the point level. The unified setup enables consistent analysis of model behaviour under shared scoring and calibration assumptions.\n  Our results demonstrate that anomaly detection performance in cloud systems is governed not only by model architecture, but critically by calibration stability and feature-space geometry.

However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise.

In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient.

Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback."}

In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions.

The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy."}

We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."}

Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics."}

To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient."}

Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality.

(2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them?

Prior work on LLM calibration largely focuses on response-level confidence, which estimates the correctness of a single generated output. However, this formulation is misaligned with many practical settings where the central question is how likely a model is to solve a query overall. We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications."}

However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach."}

This is a author version. 6 pages", "summary": "Intent-Based Networking (IBN) simplifies network management, but its reliability is challenged by \"intent drift\", where the network's state gradually deviates from its intended goal, often leading to silent failures. Conventional approaches struggle to detect the subtle, early stages of intent drift, raising alarms only when degradation is significant and failure is imminent, which limits their effectiveness for proactive assurance. To address this, we propose LEAD-Drift, a framework that detects intent drift in real time to enable proactive failure prevention. LEAD-Drift's core contribution is reformulating intent failure detection as a supervised learning problem by training a lightweight neural network on fixed-horizon labels to predict a future risk score. The model's raw output is then smoothed with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and passed through a statistically tuned threshold to generate robust, real-time alerts. Furthermore, we enhance the framework with two key features for operational intelligence: a multi-horizon modeling technique for dynamic time-to-failure estimation, and per-alert explainability using SHAP to identify root-cause KPIs. Our evaluation on a time-series dataset shows LEAD-Drift provides significantly earlier warnings, improving the average lead time by 7.3 minutes (+17.8\\%) compared to a distance-based baseline. It also reduces alert noise by 80.2\\% compared to a weighted-KPI heuristic, with only a minor trade-off in lead time. These results demonstrate that LEAD-Drift as a highly effective, interpretable, and operationally efficient solution for proactive network assurance in IBN."}

But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \\textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\\footnote{\\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box."}

Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports."}

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-Ω(Δ/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies."}

This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text.

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks."}

Conditional Gaussian processes (CGP) arise directly from Gaussian processes under conditioning and, in linear-Gaussian settings, define the full posterior distribution for a Gaussian prior and linear observations. Classical Kalman filtering is a recursive algorithm that computes this same conditional law under dynamical assumptions; the conditional Gaussian law itself is therefore the underlying representational object, while the filter is one computational realization. In this sense, CGP provides the probabilistic foundation for Kalman-type methods as well as equivalent formulations as a strictly convex quadratic program (MAP estimation), RKHS-regularized regression, and classical regularization. Ens-CGP is the ensemble instantiation of this object, obtained by treating empirical ensemble moments as a (possibly low-rank) Gaussian prior and performing exact conditioning. By separating representation (GP -> CGP -> Ens-CGP) from computation (Kalman filters, EnKF variants, and iterative ensemble schemes), the framework links an earlier-established representational foundation for inference to ensemble-derived priors and clarifies the relationships among probabilistic, variational, and ensemble perspectives."}

There is a rich literature establishing the asymptotic normality of rescaled SA iterates under fairly mild conditions. However, these asymptotic results do not quantify the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation in finite time. In this paper, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the rescaled iterate at time k and the asymptotic Gaussian limit for various choices of step-sizes including constant and polynomially decaying. As an immediate consequence, we obtain tail bounds on the error of SA iterates at any time.\n  We obtain the sharp rates by first studying the convergence rate of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process driven by general noise, whose stationary distribution is identical to the limiting Gaussian distribution of the rescaled SA iterates. We believe that this is of independent interest, given its connection to sampling literature. The analysis involves adapting Stein's method for Gaussian approximation to handle the matrix weighted sum of i.i.d. random variables. The desired finite-time bounds for SA are obtained by characterizing the error dynamics between the rescaled SA iterate and the discrete time O-U process and combining it with the convergence rate of the latter process."}

In this work, we approach this question by developing a statistical framework, combining rigorous early stopping theory with the attention-based Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for LLMs, offering new theoretical insights on fine-tuning practices. Specifically, we formally extend classical NTK theory [Jacot et al., 2018] to non-random (i.e., pretrained) initializations and provide a convergence guarantee for attention-based fine-tuning. One key insight provided by the theory is that the convergence rate with respect to sample size is closely linked to the eigenvalue decay rate of the empirical kernel matrix induced by the NTK. We also demonstrate how the framework can be used to explain task vectors for multiple tasks in LLMs. Finally, experiments with modern language models on real-world datasets provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical insights."}

However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\\%."}

We study this procedure in overparameterized linear regression: an initial estimator is trained on noisy labels, and each subsequent iterate is trained on fresh covariates with noiseless pseudo-labels from the previous model. In the high-dimensional regime, we derive deterministic-equivalent recursions for the prediction risk and effective noise across iterations, and prove that the empirical quantities concentrate sharply around these limits. The recursion separates two competing forces: a systematic component that grows with iteration due to progressive signal forgetting, and a stochastic component that decays due to denoising via repeated data-dependent projections. Their interaction yields a $U$-shaped test-risk curve and an optimal early-stopping time. In spiked covariance models, iteration further acts as an iteration-dependent spectral filter that preserves strong eigendirections while suppressing weaker ones, inducing an implicit form of soft feature selection distinct from ridge regression. Finally, we propose an iterated generalized cross-validation criterion and prove its uniform consistency for estimating the risk along the self-training trajectory, enabling fully data-driven selection of the stopping time and regularization.

To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen.

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity.

This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization."}

To isolate expressive and prosodic variation, we used recordings of a professional speaker reading a text in various styles. We compare three modeling approaches: classical acoustic features commonly used for speech emotion recognition, self-supervised speech representations, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our results demonstrate that models using self-supervised representations outperform methods with classical acoustic features, particularly in capturing complex and dynamic impressions (e.g., ``Cold--Warm'') where classical features fail.

A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead.

Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information.

Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) mitigates this issue by considering client-specific models. A widely adopted approach in PFL decomposes neural networks into a shared feature extractor and client-specific heads. While effective, this design induces a fundamental tradeoff: deep or expressive shared components hinder personalization, whereas large local heads exacerbate overfitting under limited per-client data. Most existing methods rely on rigid, shallow heads, and therefore fail to navigate this tradeoff in a principled manner. In this work, we propose a boosting-inspired framework that enables a smooth control of this tradeoff. Instead of training a single personalized model, we construct an ensemble of $T$ models for each client. Across boosting iterations, the depth of the personalized component are progressively increased, while its effective complexity is systematically controlled via low-rank factorization or width shrinkage. This design simultaneously limits overfitting and substantially reduces per-client bias by allowing increasingly expressive personalization. We provide theoretical analysis that establishes generalization bounds with favorable dependence on the average local sample size and the total number of clients. Specifically, we prove that the complexity of the shared layers is effectively suppressed, while the dependence on the boosting horizon $T$ is controlled through parameter reduction. Notably, we provide a novel nonlinear generalization guarantee for decoupled PFL models. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets (e.g., EMNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and Sent140) demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods under heterogeneous data distributions."}

By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text.

It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings."}

Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot."}

The fundamental nature of scientific evaluation needs knowledgeable grounding, collective deliberation, and multi-criteria decision-making. However, existing idea evaluation methods often suffer from narrow knowledge horizons, flattened evaluation dimensions, and the inherent bias in LLM-as-a-Judge. To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics. We construct comprehensive datasets derived from authoritative peer-reviewed submissions to benchmark InnoEval. Experiments demonstrate that InnoEval can consistently outperform baselines in point-wise, pair-wise, and group-wise evaluation tasks, exhibiting judgment patterns and consensus highly aligned with human experts."}

Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party. Model providers secret-share model weights, and users secret-share inputs, ensuring that each server operates only on random shares. While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency."}

Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces."}

In the first stage, we learn a scoring function by minimizing a scale-invariant ranking loss; in the second, we recover the target scale via isotonic regression. We theoretically characterize a class of \"Optimal-in-Rank-Order\" objectives -- including variants of RankNet and Gini covariance -- and prove that they recover the ordering of the true conditional mean under mild assumptions. We further show that subsequent monotone calibration guarantees recovery of the true regression function. Empirically, CAIRO combines the representation learning of neural networks with the robustness of rank-based statistics. It matches the performance of state-of-the-art tree ensembles on tabular benchmarks and significantly outperforms standard regression objectives in regimes with heavy-tailed or heteroskedastic noise."}

In a shared-resource congestion game with $n$ agents and congestion severity $β$, we show that SWA induces a critical threshold $λ^*=(n-β)/(n-1)$ above which agents no longer have marginal incentive to increase demand under overload, yielding a phase transition from persistent congestion to stable operation near capacity. We further provide an inference-time algorithmic instantiation of SWA that does not require parameter updates or multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a multi-agent simulation to empirically validate the predicted threshold behavior."}

First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to $\\exp(-f(x))$ supported on a convex set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $f$ is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for $K$ and a subgradient oracle for $f$, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set.\n  Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to $\\exp(-f(x)-h(x))$ with closed and convex $f$ and $h$. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with $f$ modeling data fidelity and $h$ encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of $h$ to constrained sampling in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping $f$ and $h$ separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access (such as subgradient and proximal) can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and $χ^2$ divergences."}

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment."}

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."}

We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server.

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features.

Classical machine-learning methods can struggle under these conditions, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \\textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation."}

Existing approaches either relax to continuous approximations, compromising physical fidelity, or employ separate heavyweight models for forward and inverse tasks. We propose GenPANIS, a unified generative framework that preserves exact discrete microstructures while enabling gradient-based inference through continuous latent embeddings. The model learns a joint distribution over microstructures and PDE solutions, supporting bidirectional inference (forward prediction and inverse recovery) within a single architecture. The generative formulation enables training with unlabeled data, physics residuals, and minimal labeled pairs. A physics-aware decoder incorporating a differentiable coarse-grained PDE solver preserves governing equation structure, enabling extrapolation to varying boundary conditions and microstructural statistics. A learnable normalizing flow prior captures complex posterior structure for inverse problems. Demonstrated on Darcy flow and Helmholtz equations, GenPANIS maintains accuracy on challenging extrapolative scenarios - including unseen boundary conditions, volume fractions, and microstructural morphologies, with sparse, noisy observations. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using 10 - 100 times fewer parameters and providing principled uncertainty quantification."}

In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate."}

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs."}

Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability."}

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness."}

We fine-tune GPT-4.1 models sequentially on datasets known to induce and reverse emergent misalignment and evaluate whether the models are self-aware of their behavior transitions without providing in-context examples. Our results show that emergently misaligned models rate themselves as significantly more harmful compared to their base model and realigned counterparts, demonstrating behavioral self-awareness of their own emergent misalignment.

The challenge arises due to the limited availability of a MOS-labeled training dataset comprising multi-rate speech samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models have been widely adopted in SQA to boost performance, a key limitation is that they are pretrained on 16 kHz speech and therefore discard high-frequency information present in higher sampling rates. To address this issue, we propose a spectrogram-augmented SSL method that incorporates high-frequency features (up to 48 kHz sampling rate) through a parallel-branch architecture. We further introduce a two-step training scheme: the model is first pre-trained on a large 48 kHz dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller multi-rate dataset. Experimental results show that leveraging high-frequency information overlooked by SSL features is crucial for accurate multi-rate SQA, and that the proposed two-step training substantially improves generalization when multi-rate data is limited."}

Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations."}

Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations.

In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model."}

Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation."}

These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system.

Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\\ln ξ\\sim |h - h_c|^{-ψ}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $ψ= 0.48 \\pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($ψ= 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable."}

To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time."}

Despite the development of numerous fault detection methods and their adaptations over the past decade, their practical application remains highly challenging. Given the probabilistic nature of fault occurrences and parameters, certain decision-making tasks could be approached from a probabilistic standpoint. Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets."}

We introduce an architecture that incorporates gradient networks directly into the fundamental machine equations, enabling accurate modeling of the nonlinear and coupled electromagnetic constitutive relationship. By learning the gradient of the magnetic field energy, the model inherently satisfies energy balance (reciprocity conditions). The proposed architecture can universally approximate any physically feasible magnetic behavior and offers several advantages over lookup tables and standard machine learning models: it requires less training data, ensures monotonicity and reliable extrapolation, and produces smooth outputs. These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications. We validate the proposed approach using measured and finite-element method (FEM) datasets from a 5.6-kW permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance machine. Results demonstrate accurate and physically consistent models, even with limited training data."}

Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential."}

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling."}

Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization."}

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations."}

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

Submitted to AAS journals. Comments welcome", "summary": "Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration."}
