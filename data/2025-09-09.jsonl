In\nprivacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into\nneighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget\ntargets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in\nexisting benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general\nknowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and\nrelationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic\niteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto\nstandards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically\nevaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single\nneighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure\nperformance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an\ninitial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to\nbalance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods\nare inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level\nUnlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling.

However, the effects of online vs. offline data on\nworld models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been\nthoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data.

These models often leverage fundamental time series\nproperties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an\nintrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing\nbenchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,\nrestricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there\nis no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost\nexpenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream\napplications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing\nrelation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for\nrecommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a\ncomprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct\nan extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the\nrelationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our\nexperimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we\npropose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing\ninterpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the\nfirst study to establish the relations between the properties of time series\ndata and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation\nsystem.

In\ncontrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative\npairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented\nsamples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious\ndistributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This\napproach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after\npretraining on benign traffic.

Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method.

To address\nthis, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with\nBehavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control\nstrategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method\nbegins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from\ntrajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)\ncontroller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed\nby a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process\ndynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid\noffline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable\nof handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open\nPBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral\nof Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%\nrelative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased\nsubstantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an\nimportant factor for minimizing operational costs.
