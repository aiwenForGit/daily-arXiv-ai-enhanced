During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is\nthat's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we\nhave conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language\nmodels (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral\npatterns to provide a diagnostic assessment.

This study improved Fourier\nKAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.\nThrough the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift\nmechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves\nits nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational\ncomplexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based\non teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive\nweighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the\nstudent model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD\nachieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models\nand 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark\nmodels, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%\ndecrease in inference time."}

Beyond standard data\nprocessing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning\nstrategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of\ninstruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism\nfor preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress\nnoisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model\ndeployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training\ndata, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which\ninvolves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database\nconstruction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy\nleakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM\nsignificantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM\nto achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.\nMoreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%."}

For the bivariate categorical setup with\nDirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled\nsynthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ\ntwo simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or\nconditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal\ndiscovery.

A key tool in understanding and improving such\nestimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how\ninformation about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and\ndetermines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is\nessential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant\ninformation internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher\ninformation through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it\nfrom the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance\ncorresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that\ntraining beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This\nprovides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the\nneed for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance\nof our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging\nexperiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting."}

This work investigates this question within the\nhigh-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study\nanalyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5\nPro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on\nthree distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast\ntumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the\nextremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on\nthe specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and\ntask-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist\nmodels excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness\non hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the\nfine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model\nmaintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,\nqualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,\nidentifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results\nindicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for\nspecialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with\nspecialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge\ncases."}

However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance\nand do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was\nFDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,\nwe present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an\nindividual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.\nUsing an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,\nwe trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI\nDINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a\npatient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years.

In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization\nframework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs\nby 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context\ntasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document\nsummarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm\nthat REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to\nLLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes."}

Extending\nthe foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean\nconstraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the\nframework of \"hierarchical maximum entropy\" to address these multilevel models.\nWe demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies\nacross all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via\nrenormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by\nformulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the\nDonsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore\nsettings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the\nrenormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic\nmodular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss\nfunctions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of\nparameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in\nrenormalization group theory.

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates.

However, the labeling process, especially for\nordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is\nprone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the\nperformance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses\nthe problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image\nclassification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal\nAdaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy\nlabels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution\nLearning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in\nordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and\nstandard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than\ndiscarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and\nmake optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)\nand disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric\nGaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions\n(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.\nFor instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean\nabsolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to\n0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic\nnoise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive\nlabel correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance\nthe robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of\nnoisy data."}
