In this\ncontext, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of\nlow-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of\nhigh-frequency modes (decreased participation degree).

Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps.

Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings.

Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are\ncommonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,\nwithout any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that\neventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing\nportfolio.\n  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'\nreturns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as\nan independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such\na stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary\nprocesses fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a\nstrategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,\nmatching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly\ncriterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the\ntheoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as\nlong as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the\ngeneralized Kelly criterion in the experimental market.

We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty\nlevels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from\nSnowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show\nthat SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.\nIt reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and\nsignificantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared\nwith existing methods."}

Using the PineForest active\nanomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and\ntwo extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we\ndiscovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY\nDraconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications\nand periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery\npotential in the upcoming LSST data."}

In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in\nrobot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),\nembodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the\nconventional intuition of \"more diverse is better\". Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we\npropose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the\nyielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to\nusing 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new\nperspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation\ndatasets effectively."}

However, their high\ncomputational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies\nevaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as\nlatency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.\nHowever, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\\eg\nparallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,\nmaking it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the\nefficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose\nE\\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per\nPetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for\nhardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable\nFLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even\nwithout running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with\ndifferent architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and\nbringing this issue to the attention of the research community."}
