While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade\non general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating\nsuperior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad\napplicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal\nreasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/Indolent-Kawhi/View-R1."}

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset.

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries.

In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation\napproach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy\nand discuss the implications of this limitation."}

When the number of entities is larger than\nthe model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by\nseveral orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank\nbottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate\nboth theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We\nfind that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt\nranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the\nlanguage modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer\nto break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models.

This analysis is\nenabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by\nleveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for\ndesigning robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion\n$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We\nanalytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$.

While most existing studies focus on determining whether\nentire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source\ntexts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in\nmixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter\nin a mixture model based on \\emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this\nparameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone\nconsistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ\ncontinuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion\nparameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient\nestimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased\nwatermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable\nestimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve\nthese lower bounds.
