Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large\nlanguage models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) problem.

It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to\nunderstanding information diffusion processes and to improving the\neffectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these\nprobabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations\nbetween peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence\nrelationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from\ninterventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or\noptimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher\ninfluence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence\nprobabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a\nfundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation\nerror, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an\nuncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains\nany pair within this trade-off.

However, these\nmethods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known\ninterventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent\nconfounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,\nreal-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,\nwithout prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is\ndifficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and\neven harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity.

This paper presents a\nstreamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to\nassess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate\nthis framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,\n2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To\nensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each\nmodel's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks\nrequiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical\ndiagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our\nmethodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact\ntest suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets\ndistinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content\nconstraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate\nmodels from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and\nemerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing\ncomparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes\nand identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work\ncontributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive\nempirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the\ncontemporary LLM landscape."}

Many practical\nchallenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including\nthe considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial\ncomputational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven\nmethods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a\ntypical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of\nmultiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the\nsampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events\nbut with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or\n$\\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the\navailable data. $\\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'\nextreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an\nobservable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available\nthrough qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of\nstatistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while\nenforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the\ngeneration of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack\nextremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a\nrigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.\nAdditionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable\nproperties of the $\\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and\nreal-world precipitation downscaling problems."}

RL workflows involve\ninterleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource\nrequirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales\nefficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training\nrequires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL\nframeworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated\narchitectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing\nboth stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without\nmodifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource\nunder-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances\non public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant\ncost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently\nharvested for rollout.\n  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient\nRL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources.

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data.

Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth.

However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication.

Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that\nLLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing\nto novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models."}

To address this\nproblem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch\ninference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large\nlanguage model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's\nreasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper\nexploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception\nmodule identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of\nthe preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a\nhigh-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention\nmodule interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the\nswitch, and inserts a \"deepening prompt\" to encourage further exploration along\nthat promising path.

The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment\nbetween these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation\n(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence\nbetween the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is\nmisaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance\nrate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target\nmodel's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that\nincorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a\nreference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling\nthe distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on\nsimpler tokens.
