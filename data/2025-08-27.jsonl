We propose a\nsimple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should\nalso be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of\nthought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher\nmodel's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow\nto deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and\nschedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT\ncorrelates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)\nDoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under\nmatched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given\nlight formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss\nthreats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical\nmitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,\ninterpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training."}

Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nprevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning\nLLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using\nchain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost\nof generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does\nnot take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which\nintegrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from\ntraining data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training\ndata. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to\navoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness\nof Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we\nretrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table\nunderstanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,\nshowing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform\nprevious baselines in tabular reasoning."}

Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often\nrely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and\ncapturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by\nintroducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local\nlatent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent\nspace. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds\ndistortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative\ndistances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce\nbetter-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-\nfrom out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves\nstrong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across\nregression and classification tasks."}

Empirically, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image\ngeneration, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned\nor composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the\nequally-weighted approach.

In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a\nlarge dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels\ncan benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a\nsmall-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target\nfor the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity\nobtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the\nshapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can\nboost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high\n(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data."}

Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,\nadaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep\nlearning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,\nadaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent\nbehavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each\ntrained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We\nidentify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static\nnature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our\narchitecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial\ndefenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When\nany agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active\nlearning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.\nAn ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures\nrobust final predictions."}

Recent breakthroughs, such\nas the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential\nfor quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental\ntheoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems\nrealize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only\nglobal pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators\nis, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and\nbosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical\nsuperlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with\nexperimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment\n- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex\neffective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware\nconstraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body\ninteractions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics\non a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key\nexperimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position\nfluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration\npulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal\ndynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming\nboth the expressivity and feasibility of our approach.

Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's\ndecisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as\nbeliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles\nemerges from these differences, highlighting that \"style\" is an essential but\noften overlooked dimension of intelligence.\n  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing\nand analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines\nits foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical\nperspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,\nwe construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction\nloop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On\nthis basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable\nindicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.\n  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and\nmeasuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized\nstate spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive\nbalance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement\nlearning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific\nstylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style\nlearning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential\nof these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive\nentertainment.\n  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of\nstyle as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI)."}
