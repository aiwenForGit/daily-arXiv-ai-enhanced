To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for\nimproved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances\nfurther enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most\nrelevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques\nare limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed\nsequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown\nbeforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently\n(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.\nThis renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially\nrecomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing\ncross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to\nreduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of\nattention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV\ntakes into account the complementary information of other contexts when\nsparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified\ninformation. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length\nto 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,\nsignificantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios."}

Also,\nsystematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even\nimpractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a\nmeta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal\nsettings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model\nbehaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with\nminimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with\nhandcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal\ncharacteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance\nacross diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors\nfor a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that\nM3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test\nscenarios with minimal computational overhead."}

In the first\naspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal\ndependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series\nsequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,\nCC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate\nknowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive\nmodeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy\nin both full-data training and few-shot learning situations."}

Focusing on the AIDE\nframework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)\nCode-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code\nover iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different\nsolution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,\nwhich highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By\nintegrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a\nstructured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective\ndebugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to\ntackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides\nvaluable insights into the iterative coding process."}

However, due to physiological differences\nbetween subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and\nequipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges,\nespecially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems,\nwe propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning\nto fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier\ndiscrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a\ndual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a\nthree-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and\nminimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision\nboundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers\nalso maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise\ncross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise\nlearning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity\nproblem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted\nsystematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED,\nSEED-IV and SEED-V databases.

We implemented several\nstate-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query\nexpansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander\nhas superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information\nRetrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with\nimprovements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%\nover the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under\nquery perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up\nto 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we\npublish our paraphrased benchmarks.

For\nproduct understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures\ndrive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one\nalignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue\nthat generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant\npotential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,\nachieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:\nthe lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the\ncommon presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a\nstandard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the\nfirst generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation\nlearning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for\ntargeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)\neffectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the\ndistraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the\nspecialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity\nof negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark\nMBE for various product understanding tasks.

We present a\ngenerative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models\n(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,\nnonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates\nthe inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric\ndescriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based\nrepresentations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these\nconfigurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and\npostprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation\nsetup, and descriptor extraction methods.

In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.
