This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion\nmodels, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models\nface \"mode collapse,\" where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over\ntime. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a\nneuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods\nmitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically\nrequiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only\ncompact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal\narchitecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity\npatterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving\ncritical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual\nconcepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in maintaining model versatility.

Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry\ndistinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of\ninterpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm,\ncarefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent\nmethodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of\nthe MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we\nsubstantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's\ninherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global\nunderstanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with\npost-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual\npredictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution\nmethods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and\nword-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome.

This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online\nstore) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model\nupdates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby\npreserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing\nFL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data,\ndespite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to\nenrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this\nend, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform\ncollaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender\nsystem. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item\nlists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or\nlocally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of\nsparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional\nchallenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and\nirrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational\ncosts. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively\naugments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the\nglobal dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract\nglobal structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess\nclient-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability\nestimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions.\nFedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL\nenvironments."}

However, when the target signal\nlacks low-frequency components and is dominated by broadband high frequencies,\ntraining suffers from a 'spectral bottleneck', and the model fails to\nreconstruct the entire signal, including the frequency components that lie\nwithin the network's representational capacity. We examine such a scenario in\nthe context of implicit neural representations (INRs) with sinusoidal\nrepresentation networks (SIRENs), focusing on the challenge of fitting\nhigh-frequency-dominant signals that are susceptible to spectral bottleneck. To\neffectively fit any target signal irrespective of it's frequency content, we\npropose a generalized target-aware 'weight perturbation scheme' (WINNER -\nweight initialization with noise for neural representations) for network\ninitialization. The scheme perturbs uniformly initialized weights with Gaussian\nnoise, where the noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral\ncentroid of the target signal. We show that the noise scales can provide\ncontrol over the spectra of network activations and the eigenbasis of the\nempirical neural tangent kernel. This method not only addresses the spectral\nbottleneck but also yields faster convergence and with improved representation\naccuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in audio fitting and\nachieving notable gains in image fitting and denoising tasks. Beyond signal\nreconstruction, our approach opens new directions for adaptive weight\ninitialization strategies in computer vision and scientific machine learning."}

With\nonly upper bounds $N_{ub} \\ge N$, a Surrogate mode uses a parent-anchored\nsurrogate race without winner reuse; because $-\\log \\hat t \\ge -\\log t$, the\nfrontier invariant holds and stopping remains sound. We add a compiler from\nshared-node DAGs to prefix DAGs, local finiteness checks, a SuffixCountDP\nroutine for exact counts with safe downgrades, a validator-side tightening term\n$\\kappa = \\log(N/N_{ub})$, and an auditable ledger/validator that replays runs\ndeterministically. We also give an absolute LogSumExp tail bound, an acyclicity\ncertificate, and a fallback PRF-per-leaf scheme (NoCert) whose work matches a\nrealized-score best-first baseline up to a small per-node overhead. Finally, we\nintegrate a price/latency/$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-aware multi-LLM controller and\nDP-trained LoRA adapters chosen at runtime; these choices do not affect the\ntwo-mode frontier invariants.

This article will also provide an application for time series\nanalysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where\nthe invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a\nsimple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which\nthe suggested invariants improved the performance."}

A fundamental problem in\ndeveloping and validating adaptive algorithms is the lack of a ground truth in\nreal-world financial data, making it difficult to evaluate a model's ability to\ndetect and recover from these drifts. This paper addresses this challenge by\nintroducing a novel framework, named ProteuS, for generating semi-synthetic\nfinancial time series with pre-defined structural breaks. Our methodology\ninvolves fitting ARMA-GARCH models to real-world ETF data to capture distinct\nmarket regimes, and then simulating realistic, gradual, and abrupt transitions\nbetween them.
