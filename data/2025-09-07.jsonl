This is the same metric that underlies\ncommon visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective\nliterally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare\nit to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of\ntasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of\noptimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight\nimprovement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These\nnew optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the\neffective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature\nacting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of\nthese optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning\nrate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric\nperspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing\npreconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity\ncomparable to that of Adam."}

This issue\nbecomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data\narrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving\npatterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main\naspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or\nadapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent\nbatches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional\nparameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from\nchanges in underlying latent factors influencing the data.
