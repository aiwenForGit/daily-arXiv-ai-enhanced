A central theme of our review is the\ncritical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,\nincluding B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,\nGaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in\nterms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize\nrecent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving\naccuracy, efficiency, and regularization.

This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches.

Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques.

The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials.

Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL\nlargely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly\nnon-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless\nheterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,\ntime-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We\nderive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient\nnorm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this\ntrade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an\nefficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only\nstatistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image\nclassification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates\nconvergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL\nbaselines."}

Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise\nactivation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring\npre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.\nFurthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a\nmultimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and\nevaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing\nintervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for\nVLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through\nactivation engineering."}

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density\nRatio Estimation and Riesz Regression."}

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation."}
