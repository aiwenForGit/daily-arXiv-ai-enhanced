To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been\nproposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the\ntraining availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and\nthe powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these\ndata are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,\nthey will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we\nfind that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.\nThis phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly\nunlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective\nof model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the\nconvergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model\narchitecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of\nthe critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,\nimplying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.\nConsequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons\nfor UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the\nunlearnability of parameters based on this explanation.

Using\nR\\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy\nguarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to\nisolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the\nprivacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for\nmoderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the\noriginal GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM\nto FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish\ntheoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a\nlogarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results\nconfirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive\nwith non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.\nMoreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical\nperformance while maintaining the privacy guarantees."}

Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate.

Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed\nand stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,\ntook longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be\nthe most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it\noffered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of\n0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.\nHowever, it was not the most stable.

In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of\nprior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular\nsystem is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely\nsimilar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by\nrecasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium\nmodel. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from\nprevious time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by\n$10\\%-20\\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ\nbase model.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL.

In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons.

The\ndataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process\nhigh-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a\ndataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered\nby the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very\ndiverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity\nof the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts\nand missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to\nsolve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training\nand validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to\navoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical\nimage patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were\noriginally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the\ndataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide\nstatistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial\ndistribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and\nmore. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and\ncompare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,\nDepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction.

However, directly\napplying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from\ntheir text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM\" paradigm\nhas emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the\nchannel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,\nexisting adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To\naddress this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning\nrepresentations from the spectral components of CSI features can more\neffectively help bridge the domain gap.

In\ncontrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and\nthat popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases\nfrom transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and\nthose after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and\ntasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age\n(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering.

In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to\nturn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We\nintroduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical\ncardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a\nVQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an\nimprovement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light\nand 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of\n3.47."}

However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the\nimplementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting\nstrategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models. While our findings show that higher task performance and\nbetter general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate\nmodels do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as\neffect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of\nfindings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking\nmitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in\nreducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,\ncommon regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in\nreducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\n  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is\nunacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,\nanything can be presented as statistically significant."}

RL has achieved remarkable success\nin advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing\ncomplex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has\nemerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the\nrapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces\nfoundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in\nalgorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely\nto revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore\nstrategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence\n(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for\nreasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including\nfoundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream\napplications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly\nevolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for\nbroader reasoning models. Github:\nhttps://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/Awesome-RL-for-LRMs"}
