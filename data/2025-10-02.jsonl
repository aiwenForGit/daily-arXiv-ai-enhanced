Yet, existing\nzeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are\nnot adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO\nFine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically\nlearns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient\ndesign. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a\nsmall number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in\npractice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it\nacross diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.\nAccordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the\nfoundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal\noverhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner\noutperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\\% of task-model combinations,\nthereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM\nfine-tuning.

This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation\nof the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,\nfast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of\nSNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We\nprovide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical\nexperiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series\nforecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation\nstrategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that\nour proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights."}

To address this, we develop a novel\nalgorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to\nestimate both $\\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a\nconservative, data-driven threshold $\\tau_t$ on the logistic score\n$|x_t^\\top\\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary.

Since post-training LLMs via\nRL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first\nconduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal\ntraining batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality\nand (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate\ndifficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which\nidentifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an\non-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on\nthe current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high\neffective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires\nsignificantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.\nCompared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and\nachieves $12.1\\times$ and $16.9\\times$ faster speed on identifying\nintermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,\nrespectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts\nprompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging\nprompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved\ntradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused\nRL."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent\nCollaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that\nextends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.\nOur method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy\nexploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state\ninformation and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to\nperform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,\nreducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation\nfidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of\nour approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to\nmulti-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on\ntrajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence regularization.

Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of\nacquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of\nalternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into\nthe mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a\nsimple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging\nexisting policies."}

The power output is highly related to the wind speed on\nspatial and temporal levels, which can be modeled by advanced data-driven\napproaches. To this end, we use a probabilistic neural network as a surrogate\nthat accounts for the spatiotemporal correlations of wind speed. This neural\nnetwork uses ReLU activation functions so that it can be reformulated as\nmixed-integer linear set of constraints (constraint learning). We embed these\nconstraints into the placement decision problem, formulated as a two-stage\nstochastic optimization problem. Specifically, conditional quantiles of the\ntotal electricity production are regarded as recursive decisions in the second\nstage. We use real high-resolution regional data from a northern region in\nSpain. We validate that the constraint learning approach outperforms the\nclassical bilinear interpolation method. Numerical experiments are implemented\non risk-averse investors. The results indicate that risk-averse investors\nconcentrate on dominant sites with strong wind, while exhibiting spatial\ndiversification and sensitive capacity spread in non-dominant sites.\nFurthermore, we show that if we introduce transmission line costs in the\nproblem, risk-averse investors favor locations closer to the substations. On\nthe contrary, risk-neutral investors are willing to move to further locations\nto achieve higher expected profits. Our results conclude that the proposed\nnovel approach is able to tackle a portfolio of regional wind farm placements\nand further provide guidance for risk-averse investors."}

In a joint limit where data dimension,\ncontext length, and residual stream width scale proportionally, we analyze the\nlimiting asymptotics for three ICL settings: (1) isotropic covariates and tasks\n(ISO), (2) fixed and structured covariance (FS), and (3) where covariances are\nrandomly rotated and structured (RRS). For ISO and FS settings, we find that\ndepth only aids ICL performance if context length is limited.
