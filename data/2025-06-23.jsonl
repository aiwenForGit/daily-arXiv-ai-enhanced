Recently, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using\npreference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs.

By dynamically sensing modality information within attention\nheads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial\nreductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency\n(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various\nmultimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs\nand the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to\nexisting KV cache eviction methods."}

While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their\ninterpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in\nAPIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples\nwhile minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context\nwindow for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to\nthe LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning\nprompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs\ncontinue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,\nsoft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.\nFor instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these\nissues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that\nenables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently\ntransfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to\nderive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt\ntransferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential\nprivacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small\npublic dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,\npreserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts."}

The ability to extract rewards\nfrom a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that\ncan learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,\nespecially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,\npretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment\nrepresentations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate\nnoisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,\n$\\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL\nagents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder\nworks by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to\ncompleting a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not\ntrust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal\nstates using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects\nof noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data.

Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD\nproduces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to\n\\textbf{12,000$\\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains\nup to \\textbf{30\\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen\ncommon-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)\nrobust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or\nlabels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is\na viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing\nLLMs. Our project is available at\n\\href{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}{https://jerryliang24.github.io/DnD}."}

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.

The researcher, lacking expertise in\nthis topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good\nmodel. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market\ndata and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine\nlearning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial\ndata, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data,\nthe formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and\nthe evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues\nand describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual\nexamples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with\ninterpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for\nland parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point\nthe application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest\nlinear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules\non the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that\ndespite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is\nimportant in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still\npossible to build effective models of real property markets."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform.

Using SEED-Bench-R1,\nwe find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces\nlogical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%\nconsistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final\nanswers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To\naddress this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing\nboth answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.\nGRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer\ncorrectness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the\nmodel's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)\nagainst group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths\nthat are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with\nthis adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,\nachieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%\nimprovement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving\nmodel performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work\ncontributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable\npost-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and\nrobust MLLMs."}

In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that\nthe LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,\nincluding MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a\npsychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for\nhuman observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human\nrobustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans\noutperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best\nhuman observers."}
