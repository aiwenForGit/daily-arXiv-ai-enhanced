While\ntraditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel\nsurveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically\nfrom open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database\n(SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study\nfeatures a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip\nCount Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against\nthe Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across\ndemographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to\nmeasure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When\ncompared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for\ntrip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the\nvalidation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM\nmean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and\ndemonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while\nclassical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity\nduration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical\nrepresentativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot\nviability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future\nsynthetic diary evaluation systems."}

Given the previous, in this work, we explore whether\nstate-of-the-art conversational agents can design effective audio encoders to\nreplace the CLIP text encoder from Stable Diffusion 1.5, enabling image\nsynthesis directly from sound. We prompted five publicly available chatbots to\npropose neural architectures to work as these audio encoders, with a set of\nwell-explained shared conditions. Each valid suggested encoder was trained on\nover two million context related audio-image-text observations, and evaluated\non held-out validation and test sets using various metrics, together with a\nqualitative analysis of their generated images.

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all\ngrowth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy\nand 95.37 percent recall.

A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG.

There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for\nthe sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on\nquadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,\nnegative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted\nto the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate\nquadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)\nand repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the\nliterature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance.

Our analysis sheds light on\nUnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large\ndimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature.

Quantization\noffers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation\nmodels are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors\naccumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the\nfirst fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter\narchitecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations\nwith integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and\ninference, we propose $\\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that\nmitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed\nactivation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and\nreplace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,\nensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive\nexperiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin\nof its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to\n3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes.

While prior works have examined architectural limitations such as\nover-smoothing and over-squashing, these do not explain what enables GNNs to\nextract meaningful representations or why performance varies drastically\nbetween similar architectures. These questions are related to the role of\ngeneralisation: the ability of a model to make accurate predictions on\nunlabelled data. Although several works have derived generalisation error\nbounds for GNNs, these are typically loose, restricted to a single\narchitecture, and offer limited insight into what governs generalisation in\npractice. In this work, we take a different approach by deriving the exact\ngeneralisation error for GNNs in a transductive fixed-design setting through\nthe lens of signal processing. From this viewpoint, GNNs can be interpreted as\ngraph filter operators that act on node features via the graph structure. By\nfocusing on linear GNNs while allowing non-linearity in the graph filters, we\nderive the first exact generalisation error for a broad range of GNNs,\nincluding convolutional, PageRank-based, and attention-based models. The exact\ncharacterisation of the generalisation error reveals that only the aligned\ninformation between node features and graph structure contributes to\ngeneralisation. Furthermore, we quantify the effect of homophily on\ngeneralisation. Our work provides a framework that explains when and why GNNs\ncan effectively leverage structural and feature information, offering practical\nguidance for model selection."}

When deployed in a\ndecentralized or federated setting, where each client holds only a small\npartition of the data, DP-CDA faces new challenges.

We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing.
