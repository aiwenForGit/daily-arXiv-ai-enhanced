Despite these\nchanges, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns\nand the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations\ncall for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal\ndynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch\nattributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major\nchallenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive\ncomputational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational\nvalidity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint\ndistribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over\nfeasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,\nleveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at\neach stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for\nstructural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds\ntime-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability\nand sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow\nnot only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also\nachieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency\nresilience.

With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they\ncompare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality\nanalysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,\nwe evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring\ndirectional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches\noften rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of\nthe foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed\ncausality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard\nGranger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series\ngenerated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

A key challenge in training SNNs is to\nsolve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for\ntraining SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.\nHowever, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality\nobserved in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and\nmemory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.\nAlthough existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment\nby leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit\nassignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase\nmemory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this\nwork, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,\nscalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a\nlayer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices.

The success of such attacks\nheavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original\ngraph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness\nby relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local\nstructures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,\ncalled Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS).

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,\ntext-based dietary monitoring tools."}

We introduce Geometric\nRed-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through\nobject-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --\nstructurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger\ncatastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method\nintegrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,\nsimulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,\nand grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse\npolicy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static\nbenchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape\nexploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,\nobject-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally\nshow that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as\nblue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those\nshapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the\nutility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement.

Instead of\ndirectly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an\nunconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture\nthe geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging\na differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations\nconditioned on unseen observations.

The encoder captures\ninteraction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well\nas generative design with our new method LatentFrag.

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL\nintegrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw\npuzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively\nincreases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to\njointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global\nsemantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously\naddresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally\nefficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models\nfor onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in\ngeneralizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for\nreal-world HSI applications.
