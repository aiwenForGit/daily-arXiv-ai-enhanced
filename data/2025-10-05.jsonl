Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens.

While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations.

While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their\ninformation-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing\nrepresentation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,\nstop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as\nempirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles\napproach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm\ndictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In\nparticular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,\nwe derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint\nMI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of\nexisting SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,\nmaking stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI\nadmits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such\ncomponents. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and\nstatistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI\nobjective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or\napproximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical\nexplanation behind the choices of different architectural components of\nexisting SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences."}

These\nmethods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption\nthat the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or \"important\", under the\ntest distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating\nthis assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of\nanisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural\nclassifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its\nrandomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,\nand then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several\nbenchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional\nsymmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing\noptimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for\ninvariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit.

First, we\nmathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks\ncompute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as\nsuccessful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we\nconstruct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak\nthe attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space\nattacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that\nrepresentation space attacks \\emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries\nare sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that\nadversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent\non their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique\nrepresentation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models."}

This\nstudy aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in\nZanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and\na hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and\nmeteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022.

The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model\noutperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean\nSquared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean\nPercentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust\nperformance, particularly in scenarios with limited data.

Based on these insights, we propose\nExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that\norganizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy\nobjective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on\nfive backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently\nimproves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an\naverage gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR.

The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day\nbilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent\ninteraction phases.

Although all users agree on\nthe total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores\nand the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally\npartitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside\neach bin are still unordered.

We observe that the anomaly\namount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt\nembeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed\nFoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the\nnatural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for\nanomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in\nan image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class\ndetection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer\nparameters than prior methods.

To address this, we adapt Native Sparse\nAttention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts\nQwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We\nemploy a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense\nattention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to\ntoken-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves\nimproved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and\nspatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)\nreliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention\nallocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)\nthe learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks."}

More\nspecifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information\nto be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,\nand dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make\nthe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each\nphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well\nas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in\na generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though\nbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other\nmodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting."}
