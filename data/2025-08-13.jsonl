Existing\nmethods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with\nscalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel\nframework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the\npresence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach\nalternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder\ndistribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments\non synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that\nDCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery\nand confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency\nguarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness."}

Chi-Geometry generates\nsynthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological\ntraits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions\nand species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains\nexactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are\nlabeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a\ncohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict\nchirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable\nand less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the\ngraph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved\npredictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to\ngenerate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nGNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our\ndesign of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established\nall-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all\nchallenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a\ncomputational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically\nwith the number of graph nodes.

However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards.

Since AI models are\nlargely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to\nassess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision\nfor $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and\nexplain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation\nform a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link\nthe number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each\nisotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be\nfactorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms\ncorresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop).\nRemarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost\nentirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result\nis a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses."}

On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the\nprompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to\nfurther speed up on-device inference.

Conventional outdoor monitoring\nrelies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive\ndata training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,\nutilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models\nfor enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based\noutdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data\ncontains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation\nnoise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor\nenvironments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer\nbased MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design\nfor fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder\naccurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat\nthese challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,\nnamed DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy\nenvironments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify\nmodality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and\ntemporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with\nlow-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based\non quantified and calibrated uncertainty. Third, to enhance data recovery from\nfluctuating noisy modalities, we align modality distributions within a common\nsemantic space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DUAL-Health\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy and robustness."}

In this paper, we benchmark\nthese algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including\none- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and\nnext-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total\n$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling\ninterpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal\nstates of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular\nand material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems\nas thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian\nconstructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges\nconstructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned\nalgorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including\nthose constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect\none-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.\nFinally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as\nalternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed\ntemperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these\nencoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical\nqubits."}
