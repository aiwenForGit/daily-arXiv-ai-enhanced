A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware\nprompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster\nlabels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these\nclusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous\nstatistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected\nalongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical\nsignificance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large\nlanguage model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the\nproposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This\nunsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables\nclinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve\nhealth outcomes."}

At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking.

Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated\nby direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation\n($Q \\to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \\to A$) in CoT. By\ndecomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation\nanalysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance.\nOur results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that\nmodel beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how\nrationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay\nbetween task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs\nalso provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and\nmodels. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better\nprompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning\nperformance.

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore.

This paper presents a novel channel-native\nbit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where\ntransmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to\ncollectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The\nkey idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors\ncaused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved\nby designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only\ntransmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating\nthe need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the\ncatastrophic consequence of bit errors.

Their construction involves aggregating criteria\nevaluations, a common practice in Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA). In\nMCDA, various methods have been proposed to address key aspects of multiple\ncriteria evaluations, such as the measurement scales of the criteria, the\ndegree of acceptable compensation between them, and their potential\ninteractions. However, beyond producing a final score or classification, it is\nessential to ensure the explainability and interpretability of results as well\nas the procedure's transparency. This paper proposes a method for constructing\nexplainable and interpretable composite indicators using \"if..., then...\"\ndecision rules. We consider the explainability and interpretability of\ncomposite indicators in four scenarios: (i) decision rules explain numerical\nscores obtained from an aggregation of numerical codes corresponding to ordinal\nqualifiers; (ii) an obscure numerical composite indicator classifies units into\nquantiles; (iii) given preference information provided by a Decision Maker in\nthe form of classifications of some reference units, a composite indicator is\nconstructed using decision rules; (iv) the classification of a set of units\nresults from the application of an MCDA method and is explained by decision\nrules. To induce the rules from scored or classified units, we apply the\nDominance-based Rough Set Approach. The resulting decision rules relate the\nclass assignment or unit's score to threshold conditions on values of selected\nindicators in an intelligible way, clarifying the underlying rationale.\nMoreover, they serve to recommend composite indicator assessment for new units\nof interest."}

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic\nspatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints\nof spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial\ncorrelation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices.

Previous approaches\ncan be grouped into two primary \"meta-learner\" paradigms that impose distinct\ninductive biases. Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate\npotential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their\ndifference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize\nestimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently\noutperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when\nthe PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is\nsimpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand.

Under the\nstandard linear evaluation protocol, which freezes the backbone and trains only\na linear classifier, CLAMP achieves competitive performance with\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised models. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that\nneural manifolds corresponding to different categories emerge naturally and are\neffectively separated in the learned representation space, highlighting the\npotential of CLAMP to bridge insights from physics, neural science, and machine\nlearning."}

In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise\nRelevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.\nWhile LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend\nit to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially\nreduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially\neffective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --\nwhich can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).\nBuilding on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively\nremoving circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs).

By\nsignificantly reducing search time and maintaining accuracy under strict\nhardware constraints, MARCO bridges the gap between automated DNN design and\nCAD for edge AI deployment. MARCO's core technical contribution lies in its\nunique combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with Conformal\nPrediction (CP) to accelerate the hardware/software co-design process for\ndeploying deep neural networks. Unlike conventional once-for-all (OFA) supernet\napproaches that require extensive pretraining, MARCO decomposes the NAS task\ninto a hardware configuration agent (HCA) and a Quantization Agent (QA). The\nHCA optimizes high-level design parameters, while the QA determines per-layer\nbit-widths under strict memory and latency budgets using a shared reward signal\nwithin a centralized-critic, decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm. A key\ninnovation is the integration of a calibrated CP surrogate model that provides\nstatistical guarantees (with a user-defined miscoverage rate) to prune\nunpromising candidate architectures before incurring the high costs of partial\ntraining or hardware simulation. This early filtering drastically reduces the\nsearch space while ensuring that high-quality designs are retained with a high\nprobability. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100\ndemonstrate that MARCO achieves a 3-4x reduction in total search time compared\nto an OFA baseline while maintaining near-baseline accuracy (within 0.3%).\nFurthermore, MARCO also reduces inference latency. Validation on a MAX78000\nevaluation board confirms that simulator trends hold in practice, with\nsimulator estimates deviating from measured values by less than 5%."}

WR represent recurrent,\nquasi-stationary, and persistent states of the atmospheric circulation that\nexert considerable influence over the European weather, therefore offering an\nopportunity for sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasting. While much research has\nfocused on studying the correlation and impacts of the WR on European weather,\nthe estimation of ground-level climate variables, such as temperature and\nprecipitation, from Euro-Atlantic WR remains largely unexplored and is\ncurrently limited to linear methods. The presented AI model can capture and\nintroduce complex non-linearities in the relation between the WR indices,\ndescribing the state of the Euro-Atlantic atmospheric circulation and the\ncorresponding surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in Europe. We\ndiscuss the AI-model performance in reconstructing the monthly mean two-meter\ntemperature and total precipitation anomalies in the European winter and\nsummer, also varying the number of WR used to describe the monthly atmospheric\ncirculation. We assess the impact of errors on the WR indices in the\nreconstruction and show that a mean absolute relative error below 80% yields\nimproved seasonal reconstruction compared to the ECMWF operational seasonal\nforecast system, SEAS5.

These include genre\nclassification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification,\npitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal\ntechnique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music\ntagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges\nin MIR research.

We provide an\nevaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including\nLTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant\nperformance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture,\nchronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of\ncurrent models in addressing MIR tasks.

This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF\nperform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties?\nIn this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and\nempirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy\npairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently\nsatisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for\nRLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight\nmodification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or\nCondorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving\nthe alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and\nsocial choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference\nmatching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better\nreflect the goal of learning distributions over responses.

Specifically, we design a variety of\nprompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models\n(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating\nsizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with\nmultiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media\npopularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation\nstudy to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these\nimprovements.

Expert policies are then\ntrained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative\ndelta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are\ndistilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and\nrobustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real\nhumanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body\ncontrol, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid\nperformance in the real world."}

In this work, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Metis-RISE} (\\textbf{R}L \\textbf{I}ncentivizes and\n\\textbf{S}FT \\textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike\nconventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,\nbeginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy\nOptimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning\ncapacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges\nidentified during RL: (1) \\textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks\nwhere the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which\nwe tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;\nand (2) \\textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting\nexpert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This\nstrategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement\nforms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B\nparameters).

While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy.

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly\nrelease MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1."}

On the other hand, data-driven machine learning models such as\nvariational autoencoders are not guaranteed to identify a parsimonious\nrepresentation. As a result, they can suffer from poor generalization\nperformance and reconstruction accuracy in the regime of limited and noisy\ndata. We propose a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture that\ncombines the interpretability of physics-based models with the flexibility of\ndata-driven models. To promote disentanglement of the known physics and\nconfounding influences, the latent space is partitioned into physically\nmeaningful variables that parametrize a physics-based model, and data-driven\nvariables that capture variability in the domain and class of the physical\nsystem. The encoder is coupled with a decoder that integrates physics-based and\ndata-driven components, and constrained by an adversarial training objective\nthat prevents the data-driven components from overriding the known physics,\nensuring that the physics-grounded latent variables remain interpretable. We\ndemonstrate that the model is able to disentangle features of the input signal\nand separate the known physics from confounding influences using supervision in\nthe form of class and domain observables.

Recently, Nguyen et al.\n2024's \"Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM\nOutputs\" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior\nquality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p\nsampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's\nrecognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection\nfor an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of\nthe evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the\noriginal paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human\nevaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and\ndescribed qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p\ndid not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between\nquality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original\npaper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,\nand rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve\nover baselines.
