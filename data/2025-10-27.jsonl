As environments grow more realistic, belief\ndistributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot\naccurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining\nrepresentational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic\nmodeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately\nrepresent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal\nbelief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal\nagent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient\nStein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal\nbeliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal\ndistributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two\nkey innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between\nstate dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates\nwhile preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's\nattractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of\nintricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or\nparametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically\nadapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive\ndistributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through\nextensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal\ndistributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and\ndownstream decision quality."}

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its\ncorresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting\nthe mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even\nboth, without modifying the objectives or architectures.

Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This\npaper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical\ntestbed for CRL."}

Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by\noverhead and numerical instability.\n  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical\nrepresentations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal\nTransport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework.

Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,\nwhich limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce\nDeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous\nthinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent\nreasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,\nparticularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the\naccumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding\nmechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,\nand tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical\ninformation. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we\ndevelop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that\nleverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to\nassign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments\non eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,\nTMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,\nHLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both\nlabeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step\ntoward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code\nand demo are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/DeepAgent."}

We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a\nlong-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains\nfour points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other\nwell-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple\nPolygon Problem.\n  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard\nvisual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image\nrepresenting a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.\nThe model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct\nconfigurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.\n  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and\ndomain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric\nrepresentations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on\nthe visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a\nsurprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.\nBeyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader\nparadigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework\nfor approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a\nfar wider class of challenging geometric tasks."}
