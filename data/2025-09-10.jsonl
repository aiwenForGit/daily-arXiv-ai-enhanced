Therefore, healthcare\nproviders and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for\npreventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,\nindividualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep\nquality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional\nlayers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent\nlayers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and\na two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first\nadaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the\ntraining set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism\nis employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We\nconducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11\ndays) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model\nconsistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,\nincluding Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The\nbest performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day\nprediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.\nFurthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer\nforecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction\nwindow), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We\nalso conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features\ninfluence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework\noffers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep\nforecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices."}

Each node can be\nrepresented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,\nenabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context\nlearning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework\nthat first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,\napplies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their\noutputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world\ndatasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and\nstate-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for\nscalable and generalizable graph learning."}

Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions.

While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.

To address\nthis, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an\nAdaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,\na Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple\ncandidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their\nstrengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a\nlogarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.\nThe modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that\nregulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of\ncomponents that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.\nEmpirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the\nproposed method."}

This symmetry, linking forward\nactivations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the\nselection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with\nsubstantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge\nthis assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise\ngradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,\nprovided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted\non foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -\nconfirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional\ngradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and\nmay even enhance training stability and efficiency.

In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training\nframework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out\ninter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature\nspace. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class\nneighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto\nthese neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant\nof neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly\ncontributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments\nacross standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that\nour method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading\nadversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both\nrobust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing\ninter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in\nDNNs."}
