Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\nhave been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations\ninto sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs\npromote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their\nbase models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,\ngreater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often\nimpairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,\nwe propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention\nmethod that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted\nsuppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal."}

Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used\nmachine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness\nthroughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and\naccurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative\napproach based on certified training (which requires neural network\nverification during training)."}

While this\naccessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also\nintroduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).\nRecent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate\na target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,\nposing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this\npaper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense\nstrategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to\nattack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis\ncovers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights\nchallenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off\nbetween preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs\nwithin different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,\nlegal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future\nresearch. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for\nresearchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and\nprivacy.

These weights are then used to guide standard preference\nlearning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches\nstruggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning\nfrom preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage\nboth feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks."}

More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well.

For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation."}

Despite its proven empirical success\nin applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected\nimprovement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the\nobjective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the\nbest posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent\n(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices\nof the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the\ncumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we\nshow that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared\nexponential (SE) and Mat\\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time\nthat GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound\nor has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\\'ern kernels.\nOur results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when\npractitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting.

Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production\nsystems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and\ncriteria.

We develop\ntheoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this \"fuzziness\" when\nestimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules.
