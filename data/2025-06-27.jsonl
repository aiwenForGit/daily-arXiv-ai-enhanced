Our comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities\n(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)\nreveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500\nsamples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance\nhierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly\noutperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic\nperformance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL\nachieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured\ndata modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior\ncommunication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558\ncommunications while maintaining high performance.

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement\non diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely\ndependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,\nenabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and\ntest.

Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing\ntime-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,\nconsuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,\nleverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are\nexponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these\nparadigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models\nhave important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron\nimplementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring\nrepeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use\nconventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we\npropose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these\nchallenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a\nspiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic\nspike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS\nneurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a\nhardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global\nclassical backpropagation.

A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection.
