In contrast,\nSimplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,\nmaintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear\ntransformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing\nover-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the\nmodel's expressive capacity.\n  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a\nnovel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving\ntheir expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)\nlayer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)\nlow-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and\n(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and\naccelerate convergence.

Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI\ntools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set\nof synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method\nresults in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being\nvery close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying\nproblems.

These innovations\nencompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an\nimproved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly\nstabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our\nwork demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a\nparticular domain at low cost. We open-source our model and code at\nhttps://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius3-Math."}

While deep learning has\ndemonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,\nachieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable\nremains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent\nrepresentation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of\nKAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing\ndynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the\nNeural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to\nrefine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered\nequations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE\nachieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent\nmodels that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems."}

Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches.

This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration\n(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these\nchallenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL\nmethods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios\nin which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It\nemploys a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a\nglobal guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.\nThis matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in\nsubsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the\nglobal model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent\nin non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since\nonly a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a\nstrong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the\nneed for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client\nscenario.

The constraints on the Tsallis entropy\nare in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to\n$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not\nnormalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);\nhowever, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide\nevidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\\kappa$, where\n$d$ is the dimension and $\\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary\nrobustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for\nthe coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential\nfamily, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables\n$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,\n$q=1+\\frac{\\alpha\\kappa}{1+d\\kappa}$, where $\\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter\ngoverning the shape of distributions near their location and $\\kappa$ is the\nparameter determining the asymptotic tail decay.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}
