However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model\nsizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and\nenergy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has\nemerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency\nwithout the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing\npruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require\ncomputationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a\nnovel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained\nLLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages\nboth weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate\nredundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,\nand easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM\narchitectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of\nstandard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner\nsurpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight\nupdates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the\nhighest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the\ncorresponding codes publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner."}

Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.\nFirstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a\nCross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically\nquery and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams\nwithin the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a\nhierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,\nand interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional\nparameter efficiency.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed.

Second, a ridge penalty\nterm is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature\nspace. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric.

In this paper we focus on the application\nof MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,\nwhere they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.\nDespite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI\nelement coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the\nnature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the\nsemantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation\nspaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual\nmodule capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an\nIoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our\napproach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment\nthe training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.\nThis data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the\nIAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent\nin traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over\ntraditional training paradigms."}

Our results show that sarcasm\npre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and\nF1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by\n7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the\ntraining process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit\nand explicit hate."}
