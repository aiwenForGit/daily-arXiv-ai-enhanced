Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,\nhowever, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational\noverhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose\nCudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and\noptimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human\nexperts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing\ncorrectness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More\nspecifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that\niteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating\nhardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive\nevaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,\nachieves 97.6\\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\\times$\nspeedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,\nCudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,\n3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,\nQwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency.

However, existing GNNs exhibit poor\ngeneralization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in\ndynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent\nnon-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving\nGraph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware\ninvariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment\nsequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer\nthe underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for\nenvironment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address\nenvironmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we\nconduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture\nof instantiated environment samples.

In this paper, we propose an approach to\nautomatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our\nmethod makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior\nto migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely\nPyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code\nbetween the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.\nExperimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully\nmigrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the\noriginals. Artefacts from our work are available online."}

However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we\nperform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on\ninterpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a\nnon-interpretable model.

In this work we\nintroduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a\nnew evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;\ngeneralization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to\nsatellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also\ndevelop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its\ncross-satellite performance.

The model couples\nmulti-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic\nlatent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories\nand predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic\nO-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with\n32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster\ninference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening."}

In this work, we\nrevisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field\n(MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and\nprivacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with\ninherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss\nfunction via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational\nand communication advantages over conventional convex approaches.

Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce\nOrion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)\nmulti-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)\nblock-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for\nscalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style\nmemory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across\ndiverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nwhile scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new\nstandard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

A key technical\ningredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity --\nface dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms:\n(1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has\noptimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite\n\\emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that\nscales with $r/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and\n$r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and\n(2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g.,\nlow-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has\noptimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires\n$O(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both\nthe ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions).

We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid\nteleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control\nwhile advancing scalability.

Under Review", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but\nremain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with\nlarge aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate\ntext, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning\nsupport. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates\nexisting foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible\nmultimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user\nintent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their\noutputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,\naudio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of\nspecialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while\nmaintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is\nmodular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models\nbecome available. %We release an open-source implementation to support\ncontinued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning."}
