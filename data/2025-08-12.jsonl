This work rejects that premise. It\nproposes that survival is not an externally annotated target but a geometric\nconsequence: an emergent property of the curvature and flow inherent in\nbiological state space. We develop a theory of Self-Organizing Survival\nManifolds (SOSM), in which survival-relevant dynamics arise from low-curvature\ngeodesic flows on latent manifolds shaped by internal biological constraints. A\nsurvival energy functional based on geodesic curvature minimization is\nintroduced and shown to induce structures where prognosis aligns with geometric\nflow stability. We derive discrete and continuous formulations of the objective\nand prove theoretical results demonstrating the emergence and convergence of\nsurvival-aligned trajectories under biologically plausible conditions. The\nframework draws connections to thermodynamic efficiency, entropy flow, Ricci\ncurvature, and optimal transport, grounding survival modeling in physical law.\nHealth, disease, aging, and death are reframed as geometric phase transitions\nin the manifold's structure. This theory offers a universal, label-free\nfoundation for modeling survival as a property of form, not annotation-bridging\nmachine learning, biophysics, and the geometry of life itself."}

It also shows convergence guarantees under strong\nregularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under\nsignificant label skew ($\\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The\nHeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak\naccuracy, final accuracy, and training stability. Specifically, HeteRo-Select\nachieves a peak accuracy of $74.75\\%$, a final accuracy of $72.76\\%$, and a\nminimal stability drop of $1.99\\%$. In contrast, Oort records a lower peak\naccuracy of $73.98\\%$, a final accuracy of $71.25\\%$, and a larger stability\ndrop of $2.73\\%$.

Typically, SDMs relate species occurrences to\nenvironmental variables representing abiotic factors, such as temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil properties. However, species distributions are also\nstrongly influenced by biotic interactions with other species, which are often\noverlooked. While some methods partially address this limitation by\nincorporating biotic interactions, they often assume symmetrical pairwise\nrelationships between species and require consistent co-occurrence data. In\npractice, species observations are sparse, and the availability of information\nabout the presence or absence of other species varies significantly across\nlocations. To address these challenges, we propose CISO, a deep learning-based\nmethod for species distribution modeling Conditioned on Incomplete Species\nObservations. CISO enables predictions to be conditioned on a flexible number\nof species observations alongside environmental variables, accommodating the\nvariability and incompleteness of available biotic data. We demonstrate our\napproach using three datasets representing different species groups: sPlotOpen\nfor plants, SatBird for birds, and a new dataset, SatButterfly, for\nbutterflies.

Despite this, popular\nalgorithms for tasks such as image super-resolution, stylization, and\nreconstruction enjoy empirical success. Rather than establishing distributional\nassumptions or restricted settings under which exact posterior sampling is\ntractable, we view this as a more general \"tilting\" problem of biasing a\ndistribution towards a measurement. Under minimal assumptions, we show that one\ncan tractably sample from a distribution that is simultaneously close to the\nposterior of a noised prior in KL divergence and the true posterior in Fisher\ndivergence. Intuitively, this combination ensures that the resulting sample is\nconsistent with both the measurement and the prior. To the best of our\nknowledge these are the first formal results for (approximate) posterior\nsampling in polynomial time."}

However, a persistent concern remains\nunresolved, i.e., whether and which attribution methods faithfully reflect the\nactual contribution of input variables to the decision-making process. The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention.

The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing\nEvaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative\ncategories according to category-level statistics, \\textit{e.g.}, category\nfrequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of\nLVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing\nobject hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that\noverlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative\nobject categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination\nsearching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate\nthe most misleading distractors (\\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or\nincorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which\nserves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination.

Although several methods now exist for\ndetecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically\nvalidated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection.

This real-time filtering,\nknown as triggering, involves complex processing happening often at frequencies\nas high as 40 MHz. This thesis contributes to understanding how machine\nlearning models can be efficiently deployed in such environments, in order to\nmaximize throughput and minimize energy consumption. Inevitably, modern\nhardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in\norder to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.\nIn this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for\ncharged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The\npipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely\non GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms\ncurrently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA\narchitecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing\nspeed was compared against the GPU implementation."}

Previous\napproaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with\npredetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark\nproblems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any\nfixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the\nReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for\nstateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding\nconstraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific\nexpertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The\nagent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and\ncode execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and\nverify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,\nthis architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench\nconstraint programming benchmark set.

Through two case studies,\nAI-assisted consumer credit decisions and AI-assisted content moderation, we\ndemonstrate how the seemingly neutral use of uncertainty thresholds can trigger\ndiscriminatory impacts. We argue that, although both interventions pose risks\nof unlawful discrimination under UK law, selective frictions offer a promising\npathway toward fairer and more accountable AI-assisted decision-making by\npreserving transparency and encouraging more cautious human judgment."}

The simple nature of data\ncollection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in\nproperly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal\nDepression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data\nobtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual\ntransformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features\nfor efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:\nan acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic\nattributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant\nhigh-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among\nthe generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and\na detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature\nrepresentations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal\nD-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal\ndepression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for\nF1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system.

To enforce\nnorms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics\nmethods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly\nappealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art\ndetectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called\nGenerative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900\nstudent-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various\ndomains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we\npropose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution\nto a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to\nslightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to\nactive attacks on the detector by \"humanizing\" generated texts. We show that\nmost detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student\ncontribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are\nparticularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in\neducational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'\nlives.

In\ncontrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the\nvelocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by\nimposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only.\nThe effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and\nleads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function\nand its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data\ndistributions confirm the validity of the effective potential."}

Code is available at:\n  https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA", "summary": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually\nlearn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL\nmethods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks\nusing additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect\nmodule selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules\noften overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing\nbetween similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this\npaper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most\ncrucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an\nentropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.\nFurthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal\nadapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We\ncombine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both\nspecialized and general knowledge during inference.

The sensing stage\nperforms logit-domain Bayesian updates with trimmed aggregation and\nattention-weighted consensus, and the base station (BS) fuses network beliefs\nwith a conservative minimum rule, preserving detection accuracy under a bounded\nnumber of Byzantine users. Conditioned on the sensing outcome, we pose downlink\ndesign as sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization under transmit-power and\nsignal-leakage constraints and jointly optimize the BS precoder, IRS phase\nshifts, and user equalizers. With partial (or known) CSI, we develop an\naugmented-Lagrangian alternating algorithm with projected updates and provide\nprovable sublinear convergence, with accelerated rates under mild local\ncurvature. With unknown CSI, we perform constrained Bayesian optimization (BO)\nin a geometry-aware low-dimensional latent space using Gaussian process (GP)\nsurrogates; we prove regret bounds for a constrained upper confidence bound\n(UCB) variant of the BO module, and demonstrate strong empirical performance of\nthe implemented procedure. Simulations across diverse network conditions show\nhigher detection probability at fixed false-alarm rate under adversarial\nattacks, large reductions in sum MSE for honest users, strong suppression of\neavesdropper signal power, and fast convergence.

Our approach operates on\ndeterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose\nfeature statistics align with key-derived targets.
