Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of\nmodels show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially\nlowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H\nbenchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety\nperformance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that\nachieve both low false refusal rates and high safety."}

Dig-DEC is always no larger than\noptimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the\nremoval of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without\nexplicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic\ntransitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret\nbounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition\nstructures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al.

These\nissues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and\ninterpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where\nthe model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on\ntokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated\nAttention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for\nperforming 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA\nintroduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value\nvectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the\nunderlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of\nitself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than\nprior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory\npathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its\nemergent value representation.

This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive\nbecause the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by\nchance.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al.

For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless\nintegration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,\nensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array\nof analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity\nindices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation\nmethods of novel paradigms.

To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless\npoisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling\nusers to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we\npropose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge.\nWe introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data\npoisoning: {\\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\\em poisoning-concurrent\nwatermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within\nthe range of $\\Theta(1/\\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_p)$ for\npoisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably\nensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the\npracticality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks. We validate our\ntheoretical findings through experiments on several attacks, models, and\ndatasets."}

Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score.

In the\nliterature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella\nterm of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the\nlogical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)\nusing the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.\nThough simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of\nformal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning\nabilities.

Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions\nfrom set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented\nconditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal\nautoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our\napproach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set.
